Most people with high cholesterol don’t have it under control, even though it is both preventable and treatable. According to the National Cholesterol Education Program, adults 20 years of age and older should have their cholesterol checked every five years. And, with two out of three adults suffering from high cholesterol, keeping track of your cholesterol is important.\nWhat is cholesterol?\nCholesterol is a waxy substance, sort of like fat, that can coat the walls of your arteries, forming a “plaque.” This is also referred to as “hardening of the arteries” or atherosclerosis. You’ll often hear comments like, “Those fast-food cheeseburgers will clog your arteries” — regularly eating food that is high in saturated fat can increase the amount of cholesterol that circulates in your bloodstream, increasing your risk for health problems. When arteries have too much plaque, they narrow, and your heart has to work harder to pump blood through your body.\nOur bodies need cholesterol to function, but they’re able to synthesize it themselves — unlike many vitamins and minerals, we can make our own cholesterol and don’t need to get it from food. Cholesterol comes in two types: “good” cholesterol, or high density lipoprotein (HDL); and “bad” cholesterol, or low density lipoprotein (LDL). “High cholesterol” refers to high levels of “bad” (LDL) cholesterol in the blood. LDL is what forms plaque in the arteries, while HDL prevents plaque buildup, likely by carrying the LDL to the liver, which processes it before it’s excreted from the body.

In 2006, Kazemi’s son, Stephan Hashemi, on his own behalf and on behalf of his mother’s estate, filed a civil lawsuit in Montreal against Iran and three individual Iranian officials: Ayatollah Ali Khomeini, Iran’s Supreme Leader; Saeed Mortazavi, Tehran’s Chief Public Prosecutor alleged to have ordered Kazemi’s arrest; and Mohammad Bakhshi, the former Deputy Chief of Intelligence for Evin Prison, the site of Kazemi’s abuse.\nRelying on the SIA as a complete bar to the plaintiffs’ action, the defendants brought a motion to strike. The decision of the Quebec Superior Court was released in 2011. Justice Robert Mongeon would have allowed Hashemi’s individual claims to go forward given that he had suffered injuries in Canada (an exception under the SIA), but dismissed the claims in the name of Kazemi’s estate, as the related abuses were suffered only outside of Canada.\nOn appeal to the Quebec Court of Appeal, that Court held that the SIA operated as complete bar to prevent any of the claims from going forward. The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, at which point CLAIHR was granted leave to intervene. CLAIHR picked up the reasoning of Justice Mongeon at the Quebec Superior Court and argued that serious psychological trauma, when suffered in Canada, constitutes an exception to state immunity under s. 6(a) of the SIA. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately rejected this argument and upheld the decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal.\nUnlike the United States, Canada has no alien tort statute. The plaintiffs and certain interveners in Kazemi relied, in part, on international law, and particularly the prohibition of torture as a jus cogens norm to ground their cause of action. The Honourable Justice LeBel, for the majority, agreed that the prohibition of torture is jus cogens, but that there was no requirement under international law that Canada open its courts to permit its citizens to seek redress through civil claims for torture committed abroad.\nJustice LeBel did suggest that Parliament could choose to offer the plaintiffs redress, noting:\nParliament has the ability to change the current state of the law on exceptions to state immunity, just as it did in the case of terrorism, and allow those in situations like Mr. Hashemi and his mother’s estate to seek redress in Canadian courts. Parliament has simply chosen not to do it yet. [Emphasis added.]\nThe “yet” at the end of the Supreme Court of Canada decision suggests that the Court itself would like to see Parliament make this change. Efforts are underway to lobby the federal government to adopt legislation that would enable Canadians to seek redress for torture suffered abroad. While such a law would not go as far as the alien tort statute, it would help Canadians hold states which commit human rights abuses accountable for their actions. In the meantime, supporters of international human rights will have to satisfy themselves with the Honourable Justice Abella’s dissent in the Kazemi decision:\nIn the face of universal acceptance of the prohibition against torture, concerns about any interference with sovereignty which may be created by acting in judgment of an individual state official who violates this prohibition necessarily shrink. The very nature of the prohibition as a peremptory norm means that all states agree that torture cannot be condoned. Torture cannot, therefore, be an official state act for the purposes of immunity ratione materiae.\nBy webmaster|2015-02-12T11:55:33-05:00February 12th, 2015|Blog|\nRecent Updates\nClimate Change Litigation in Canada October 29, 2022\nCorporations as Good Citizens: Can respect for human rights and the environment be good business?

It’s a physical, reconfigurable space composed of an interactive classroom and an open space including five different zones, each of which are equipped with specific furniture and technology. The facility was officially launched in January 2012.\nThe FCL will be used to:\nStimulate discussions and illustrate practice related to a range of current and prospective innovative teaching and learning scenarios.\nProvide hands-on training facilities for teachers, head teachers and ICT advisers.\nAct as a venue for meetings, workshops and events for Ministries of Education, regional education authorities and commercial partners.\nProvide a platform where policy makers, practitioners and ICT suppliers can come together in order to rethink how teaching and learning can take place in 21st century classrooms and other learning spaces.\nAll three CPDLab courses will be delivered in the Future Classroom Lab. Moreover, CPDLab is closely linked with the FCL dissemination and communication activities giving it a wide visiblity among all the FCL visitors including national and regional education authories, European level decision makers and industry partners.\niTEC – Designing the future classroom\niTEC (Innovative Technologies for an Engaging Classroom) is a four-year, pan-European project focused on the design of the future classroom.\nWith funding of €9.45M from the European Commission’s 7th Framework Programme, the involvement of 15 Ministries of Education and school pilots in up to 1.000 classrooms in 12 countries, iTEC is the largest and most strategic project yet undertaken by European Schoolnet and its supporting Ministries.\nThe third CPDLab course “teaching and learning activities for the future classroom“ will be based on the learning scenarios developed within the iTEC project. This will create a link between the projects and thus provide dissemination opportunities among the 27 iTEC partners, numerous Associate Partners, over 1.000 teachers taking part in the iTEC project and other stakeholders.\nInteractive Whiteboard Working Group (IWB WG)\nEuropean Schoolnet’s Interactive Whiteboard Working Group (IWB WG) was established in order that Ministries of Education can share experience related to the use of IWB technologies in schools and explore areas of common concern. It is one of five EUN working groups set up to help develop an annual work programme that is in line with priorities set by its supporting Ministries.\nCurrently 15 Ministries of Education are members of the working group: Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, and the UK. The working group is also supported by a number of IWB vendors.\nThe IWB WG will follow the work developed in the CPDLab project with a great interest since it feeds into their discussion agenda since one of the project’s courses will be on “innovative pedagogical use of Interactive Whiteboard technologies in secondary schools“.\nInsafe\nEuropean Schoolnet coordinates the European-wide Insafe network and runs many projects dedicated to promoting safe, effective use of technology by children and young people of all ages as well as by teachers and schools. Through work in the field, we have forged a leading role in Europe and internationally, collaborating with institutions such as the European Commission and the Council of Europe and actively participating in policy dialogues within the worldwide Internet Governance Forum.\nSafer Internet Day, organised since 2004, now involves thousands of local, national and international events across more than 73 countries. Resources such as the Family eSafety Toolkit and activity book created by the eSafety coordination team are being taken up internationally.\nThe Insafe network, funded by the European Commission, is at the heart of our eSafety activities, and is enriched by several satellite projects supported by indus-try. Insafe is a rapidly expanding network in both size and remit. In five years it has doubled in scale to a total of 30 national centres, reaching across the whole of the EU to Russia, Norway and Iceland.\nLegal statements | Contact\nEUN Partnership AISBL Rue de Treves 61 B-1040 Brussels Tel: +32 (0)2 790 75 75 Fax: +32 (0)2 790 75 85 info@eun.org"}
