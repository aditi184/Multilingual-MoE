Many astute readers clued us in to some of the locations of this viral video, but after reviewing the websites, I declined to include an updated link because I found them to be pretty misogynistic and exploitative. The message remains the same, though — yes, it’s possible to get maggots in a vagina; no, it’s not directly caused by an STD; and no, it’s definitely not caused by a “superbug” strain of any STD. Continue reading to get the scoop on how maggots actually can infest genitals, and what we know about their connection to STDs.\nMaggots grow up to be flies.\nOver the past couple of weeks, I’ve been confronted by two mysteries. The first was a collection of search terms that led curious Web surfers to our blog. Take a gander at them and see if you can tell why they raised my eyebrows:\nnew std that causes maggots\nwhat is the new std superbug that causes maggots\nstds that cause worms\nThere were dozens of similar searches leading to this blog, enough to make me take notice — and dig around.\nMaggots infesting your genitals isn’t something you need to worry about.\nFirst, the obvious: I Googled “STD maggots” and looked at what came up. While there was absolutely nothing to be found in the legitimate news media, there was a proliferation of recently published stories on websites that I’d never heard of, all containing the same unsourced viral video of someone removing maggots from someone else’s vagina. (Actually, I could only find stills — none of the websites I looked at had functioning video. Not that I was hugely motivated to find one that did.)\nThe accompanying articles described a female patient with a sexually transmitted disease (STD) said to be called “sex superbug,” an antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which caused maggots to grow in her vagina. While there is no STD formally called “sex superbug,” the original author was probably referring to antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea, which is caused by a strain of bacteria called Neisseria gonorrhoeae that has evolved resistance to the drugs we use to kill it. Someone would have to track down the video’s source, however, to confirm that the subject actually suffered from gonorrhea in addition to the infestation of maggots.

Most people with high cholesterol don’t have it under control, even though it is both preventable and treatable. According to the National Cholesterol Education Program, adults 20 years of age and older should have their cholesterol checked every five years. And, with two out of three adults suffering from high cholesterol, keeping track of your cholesterol is important.\nWhat is cholesterol?\nCholesterol is a waxy substance, sort of like fat, that can coat the walls of your arteries, forming a “plaque.” This is also referred to as “hardening of the arteries” or atherosclerosis. You’ll often hear comments like, “Those fast-food cheeseburgers will clog your arteries” — regularly eating food that is high in saturated fat can increase the amount of cholesterol that circulates in your bloodstream, increasing your risk for health problems. When arteries have too much plaque, they narrow, and your heart has to work harder to pump blood through your body.\nOur bodies need cholesterol to function, but they’re able to synthesize it themselves — unlike many vitamins and minerals, we can make our own cholesterol and don’t need to get it from food. Cholesterol comes in two types: “good” cholesterol, or high density lipoprotein (HDL); and “bad” cholesterol, or low density lipoprotein (LDL). “High cholesterol” refers to high levels of “bad” (LDL) cholesterol in the blood. LDL is what forms plaque in the arteries, while HDL prevents plaque buildup, likely by carrying the LDL to the liver, which processes it before it’s excreted from the body.

In 2006, Kazemi’s son, Stephan Hashemi, on his own behalf and on behalf of his mother’s estate, filed a civil lawsuit in Montreal against Iran and three individual Iranian officials: Ayatollah Ali Khomeini, Iran’s Supreme Leader; Saeed Mortazavi, Tehran’s Chief Public Prosecutor alleged to have ordered Kazemi’s arrest; and Mohammad Bakhshi, the former Deputy Chief of Intelligence for Evin Prison, the site of Kazemi’s abuse.\nRelying on the SIA as a complete bar to the plaintiffs’ action, the defendants brought a motion to strike. The decision of the Quebec Superior Court was released in 2011. Justice Robert Mongeon would have allowed Hashemi’s individual claims to go forward given that he had suffered injuries in Canada (an exception under the SIA), but dismissed the claims in the name of Kazemi’s estate, as the related abuses were suffered only outside of Canada.\nOn appeal to the Quebec Court of Appeal, that Court held that the SIA operated as complete bar to prevent any of the claims from going forward. The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, at which point CLAIHR was granted leave to intervene. CLAIHR picked up the reasoning of Justice Mongeon at the Quebec Superior Court and argued that serious psychological trauma, when suffered in Canada, constitutes an exception to state immunity under s. 6(a) of the SIA. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately rejected this argument and upheld the decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal.\nUnlike the United States, Canada has no alien tort statute. The plaintiffs and certain interveners in Kazemi relied, in part, on international law, and particularly the prohibition of torture as a jus cogens norm to ground their cause of action. The Honourable Justice LeBel, for the majority, agreed that the prohibition of torture is jus cogens, but that there was no requirement under international law that Canada open its courts to permit its citizens to seek redress through civil claims for torture committed abroad.\nJustice LeBel did suggest that Parliament could choose to offer the plaintiffs redress, noting:\nParliament has the ability to change the current state of the law on exceptions to state immunity, just as it did in the case of terrorism, and allow those in situations like Mr. Hashemi and his mother’s estate to seek redress in Canadian courts. Parliament has simply chosen not to do it yet. [Emphasis added.]\nThe “yet” at the end of the Supreme Court of Canada decision suggests that the Court itself would like to see Parliament make this change. Efforts are underway to lobby the federal government to adopt legislation that would enable Canadians to seek redress for torture suffered abroad. While such a law would not go as far as the alien tort statute, it would help Canadians hold states which commit human rights abuses accountable for their actions. In the meantime, supporters of international human rights will have to satisfy themselves with the Honourable Justice Abella’s dissent in the Kazemi decision:\nIn the face of universal acceptance of the prohibition against torture, concerns about any interference with sovereignty which may be created by acting in judgment of an individual state official who violates this prohibition necessarily shrink. The very nature of the prohibition as a peremptory norm means that all states agree that torture cannot be condoned. Torture cannot, therefore, be an official state act for the purposes of immunity ratione materiae.\nBy webmaster|2015-02-12T11:55:33-05:00February 12th, 2015|Blog|\nRecent Updates\nClimate Change Litigation in Canada October 29, 2022\nCorporations as Good Citizens: Can respect for human rights and the environment be good business?

It’s a physical, reconfigurable space composed of an interactive classroom and an open space including five different zones, each of which are equipped with specific furniture and technology. The facility was officially launched in January 2012.\nThe FCL will be used to:\nStimulate discussions and illustrate practice related to a range of current and prospective innovative teaching and learning scenarios.\nProvide hands-on training facilities for teachers, head teachers and ICT advisers.\nAct as a venue for meetings, workshops and events for Ministries of Education, regional education authorities and commercial partners.\nProvide a platform where policy makers, practitioners and ICT suppliers can come together in order to rethink how teaching and learning can take place in 21st century classrooms and other learning spaces.\nAll three CPDLab courses will be delivered in the Future Classroom Lab. Moreover, CPDLab is closely linked with the FCL dissemination and communication activities giving it a wide visiblity among all the FCL visitors including national and regional education authories, European level decision makers and industry partners.\niTEC – Designing the future classroom\niTEC (Innovative Technologies for an Engaging Classroom) is a four-year, pan-European project focused on the design of the future classroom.\nWith funding of €9.45M from the European Commission’s 7th Framework Programme, the involvement of 15 Ministries of Education and school pilots in up to 1.000 classrooms in 12 countries, iTEC is the largest and most strategic project yet undertaken by European Schoolnet and its supporting Ministries.\nThe third CPDLab course “teaching and learning activities for the future classroom“ will be based on the learning scenarios developed within the iTEC project. This will create a link between the projects and thus provide dissemination opportunities among the 27 iTEC partners, numerous Associate Partners, over 1.000 teachers taking part in the iTEC project and other stakeholders.\nInteractive Whiteboard Working Group (IWB WG)\nEuropean Schoolnet’s Interactive Whiteboard Working Group (IWB WG) was established in order that Ministries of Education can share experience related to the use of IWB technologies in schools and explore areas of common concern. It is one of five EUN working groups set up to help develop an annual work programme that is in line with priorities set by its supporting Ministries.\nCurrently 15 Ministries of Education are members of the working group: Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, and the UK. The working group is also supported by a number of IWB vendors.\nThe IWB WG will follow the work developed in the CPDLab project with a great interest since it feeds into their discussion agenda since one of the project’s courses will be on “innovative pedagogical use of Interactive Whiteboard technologies in secondary schools“.\nInsafe\nEuropean Schoolnet coordinates the European-wide Insafe network and runs many projects dedicated to promoting safe, effective use of technology by children and young people of all ages as well as by teachers and schools. Through work in the field, we have forged a leading role in Europe and internationally, collaborating with institutions such as the European Commission and the Council of Europe and actively participating in policy dialogues within the worldwide Internet Governance Forum.\nSafer Internet Day, organised since 2004, now involves thousands of local, national and international events across more than 73 countries. Resources such as the Family eSafety Toolkit and activity book created by the eSafety coordination team are being taken up internationally.\nThe Insafe network, funded by the European Commission, is at the heart of our eSafety activities, and is enriched by several satellite projects supported by indus-try. Insafe is a rapidly expanding network in both size and remit. In five years it has doubled in scale to a total of 30 national centres, reaching across the whole of the EU to Russia, Norway and Iceland.\nLegal statements | Contact\nEUN Partnership AISBL Rue de Treves 61 B-1040 Brussels Tel: +32 (0)2 790 75 75 Fax: +32 (0)2 790 75 85 info@eun.org"}

Everyone’s body always has a number of cancerous cells but these cells are usually suppressed by the immune system and are prevented from multiplying too much, such that they become harmful for the body. This means that for a normal person, having a few cancerous cells present in the body should not be a cause for concern as the immune system is more than well equipped with such a problem. However, in certain cases, due to a number of reasons, cancer cells can multiply in great numbers and can result in cancer spreading throughout the body, meaning that these cells now become harmful for the body and are damaging the body in various different ways. At this point, the number of cells is too great for the immune system to tackle and the cancer just keeps on spreading. The cancerous cells begin to have a mind of their own and begin to use up the body’s resources. This means that the resources that should have been used for the proper functioning and repair of the body itself are no longer present as they had been used up by the cancerous cells. This can lead to a multitude of negative effects for the person involved as the body does not function to the performance level that is expected of it.\nA few of the most common types of perfect bowel cancer treatment in Burwood are testicular cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer. All of these cancers can have a great impact on the lives of the people that are affected. Although, the first two types of cancers stated above can only occur in men and women respectively, colorectal cancer has an almost equal probability of occurrence in both men and women.\nImportance of Colonoscopy\nA good way to diagnose colorectal cancer is to go for a colorectal cancer treatment in Liverpool examination. Here a small camera is inserted to examine the colorectal area. This means that the doctor can have a clear look at the internals of the person that is being examined and can therefore spot any inconsistencies that are present. This can allow for the quick determination of a number of different conditions, including colorectal cancer.\nAll in all, if you need a doctor that you can rely on to make sure that you are diagnosed and treated properly for any kind of colorectal condition that you may be suffering from, then you need look no further than Dr Kate Gibson Colorectal Surgeon. With a large amount of experience in this medial industry, and having a large number of patients who have successfully recovered from their problems, you need can have the peace of mind that your colorectal needs will be dealt with the utmost care and professionalism leading to the solution to any colorectal problems that you may have!\nMedical Services\nCategories Select Category Dental Care Health & Beauty Medical Services\nEffect Of Steep Phacoemulsification Of Meridian Corneal Cut\nWhat Is Meant By A Skin Clinic?\nTips On Choosing A Physiotherapist For Physical Therapy\nHow To Take Care Of Your Teeth\nArchives Select Month March 2021 January 2021 May 2020 November 2019 August 2019 May 2019 April 2019 February 2019 January 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018\n« Mar\nPowered by WordPress and Dynamic News."}

Of course the chance to hear them play live right in front of me, or learn interesting things about them during an interview is amazing, but for me the most entertaining part is the discussions that happen before the tape is rolling or before the show begins.\nThis is the time where, even if it is only a sentence or two, I feel you can really get the coolest story of the event.\nI have yet to run into sax man Joshua Redman in a bad mood backstage. He remembers names, asks about other people at the radio station by name and tells me to say hello to them for him.\nWhile walking on stage to introduce Wynton Marsalis, one of his band members told me to wait a second because he wanted to know where the best place to eat after the show was.\nThe late Michael Brecker made it clear to me multiple times in one interview, after complimenting his recordings, that if I really wanted to enjoy his music, “you need to hear that **** live.”\nAnd the great Clark Terry, after a wonderful interview and performance, was kind enough to join some of the staff and listeners for a sandwich. God bless him, as he fell asleep while I was in the middle of a sentence. In his defense, most people start falling asleep when I talk too much.\nThinking about this made me start wondering about all of the great conversations and interactions that took place “off-mic” in recording sessions that we never got to hear.\nFor example, to be a fly on the wall, Christmas Eve, 1954. Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk are in a recording session that reportedly almost came to blows because Miles didn’t want Monk playing during his solos. Give their recording of The Man I Love a listen, and you can almost hear the animosity. I would have loved to hear that conversation take place.\nOr perhaps some studio sessions with slightly less violent interactions. How about Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington (or any recording session with either of those two guys)? I can only imagine the conversations that took place when the tape wasn’t rolling.\nCertainly there are many sessions that would have been great to be a fly on the wall for, and no doubt that with all of the ones that are racing through my mind right now, I am probably forgetting some that would have been the best.\nI invite you to share who you would have liked to overhear in the studio when the microphones were off.\nPosted on October 8, 2009 September 12, 2011\nUp in the Cotton Club\nDid anyone ever suspect that someone would mix Beyonce with Duke Ellington and his band? I can safely say I didn’t see this one coming. My music director called me into his office to give this a listen, and I truly couldn’t believe it. I must have heard Single Ladies by Beyonce a million times, but even though she is singing the lyrics, I didn’t even recognize it because of the way it was mixed with Duke.\nAnyway, you’ve got to give this a listen – just for fun.\nPosted on May 31, 2009 September 12, 2011\nRumors of Jazz Movies\nIt seems like it has been a couple years since I heard whispers of two jazz related films that were in pre-production. I hadn’t heard anything about either of these projects in a while, and decided to do some digging.\nThe first film I originally heard about from Abe Beeson on Evening Jazz a couple years ago. He had mentioned that Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor, Lucky Number Slevin) would play Chet Baker in a film called The Prince of Cool.\nThe concept of this film surfaced during the same time that the life of musicians Ray Charles and Johnny Cash were being put on the silver screen, becoming huge cinematic hits.\nThe problem, as it turns appears, is that the reasons that producers wanted to create a Chet Baker biopic and the reasons Josh Hartnett wanted to create a Chet Baker biopic were completely different. While producers wanted to rush a project in order to capitalize on the Ray and Walk the Line bandwagon, Josh Hartnett claims that he wanted to dedicate a significant amount of time and thought to the project, making it unique and original. Because Hartnett (apparently a huge jazz fan), and the producers could not come to agreement on their differences, Hartnett withdrew from the project and that is that.\nThe second film of note accumulated press in 2006 upon the announcement of it, but there has been little word of it since. The film is called The Jazz Ambassadors, and is set to star Morgan Freeman as Duke Ellington.\nThis is not so much of a biography of Duke, as it is a look at what role members of Duke’s entourage might have had in the 1963 coup let by the CIA in Iraq.\nThat’s right. It is suggested that the CIA planted spies within Duke’s band as they toured the Middle East. While your first reaction might be “yeah right”, U.S. State Department official Tom Simons, who toured with Duke’s band in the Middle East, is working on the project.\nMaybe “working on the project” is a loose term to use, as I struggled to find much work being done on the project announced three years ago at all. Freeman (who I think would make an excellent Ellington) is involved on a variety of other projects currently, as is the designated director of the film, and the only suggested release date I came up with is 2011, posted on IMDB.com.\nTake Our Poll\nLatest Jazz From NPR Music\nArchives Select Month August 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008\nSearch by Date\n« Aug\nAll About Jazz\nBlog Catalog\nJazz & Blues from NPR Music\nJazz24"}
