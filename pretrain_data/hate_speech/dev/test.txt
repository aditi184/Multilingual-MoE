In Park Slope at 1:00 a.m. , an autistic teenage girl was taken advantaged of by a man who noticed she was lost and took her to a park and sexually assaulted her .
At the 34th street station in Herald Square , a man who stalked and threatened to rape a woman , followed and previously grabbed her from the Prospect Park station in Brooklyn and tried to grope her on the escalator only to fall down the steps when the woman bit him .
Again in the East Village , a church was vandalized with graffiti and shit by young crusty homeless people and their dirty huge dogs after the pastor and his wife prevented them from sleeping , lounging and shooting smack under a sidewalk shed by there by sprinkling bleach cleansing powder on the grounds .
In Chelsea , a woman riding her bike on 20th street rode around a double parked vehicle was chased seconds later by the driver who stopped beside her and call her a fucking bitch .
On the D train , a couple of amorous deviants riding home from Yankee Stadium after the game engaged in some Risky Business and kept humping each other throughout the ride .
A 26-year-old minister from the South Bronx , threatened to rape and kill City Council Speaker and Puerto Rican nationalist and Spanish language enthusiast Melissa Mark-Viverito and her kill her family and also threatening cops who are from the LGBT communities .

The biggest of all is the unabated usage and influence of bullshit .
The following day on the official march , thousands of UTR participants showed up with flags of confederacy , white flags with black x ’ s on them and even a big ass swastika .
They even showed up with fucking homemade shields complete with emblems .
Naturally , groups of outraged people showed up to challenge their march and ruse of preserving American History and promotion of divisive hatred and their desire for domination , a modern day 21st century version of the brown shirt marches of Nazi Germany and Birth Of A Nation documentary footage .
Trump followed this idiotic many sides statement with a better fixed statement acknowledging the existence of the white supremacists and the gruesome death of Ms. Heyer ( though not the lynching of Mr. Harris ) and emphasized it with accusing the killer Shields of murder ( that should fuck up any jury selection process and delay his court case , which can be considered doing a solid for the “ blood and soil ” crowd ) .
And to top his verbiage shit spraying , he gave a tone deaf plug to his winery in the state where this recent blight on American History has happened .
It is up to the alt-right , if they insist on their beliefs that they are being oppressed and erased , to express those opinions without weaponry and stupid torches and the anti-fa to do the same , going by their protests against right wing pundits speaking at colleges because both sides are being exploited while the big club of billionaires are still raking in the dough while the blood is flowing in the streets , with people burning cars and breaking windows ( these protesters , on both sides , think these banks and chains give a shit that their windows get broken , they can easily replace them and still rob homeowners and underpay their employees ) .
And think that he defended the marauding volatile racist and fascist groups as Bannon planned his departure a week before the Charlottesville siege by white power nationalists .
Trump ’ s infection and the white power groups terror activism has led to states and cities removing confederate statues immediately , via prompt decisions with overnight removals and vigilante destruction .
Recently in the East Village in N.Y. , a sick racist asshole of a man who draped his windows of his top floor apartment with confederate flags is now the subject of a media circus and has awaken the community around there to the meaning of them , leading one resident to throw rocks at his windows to persuade him to remove them and led building management to put a humongous tarp over it .
In Concourse Village , a 12 year old girl was sexually assaulted by a man after he threatened her with a gun and forced her into an alley .
In Mott Haven , a man attempted to rob another man in an elevator with a knife and wound up getting his ass kicked when the victim defended himself .
At a Walgreens in White Plains , a woman leaving the restroom was attacked by a homeless man who tried to force her back inside and rape her , but was thwarted by the store manager who heard the victim scream .
In Elmhurst , a dispute outside a strip club escalated into a brawl , leading to a man being left dead on the pavement .
In Long Island City , a man snatched a chain off a neck of a teenage girl on the street .
Reportedly , the staff and some customers came to his defense by actually getting physical and obscenely yelling at the cops as they were frogmarching his ass out the door .
Things continued to get worse , since being a flaming diarrhetic asshole does not make for good business acumen and his investors attempts at gentrification with their arty hotel did not get any patrons except for homeless people for a little while , his pizza place shut down , leaving him temporary no place to create his revolutionary pies .
The day he closed , he left a message for the fine folks in the community who just couldn ’ t appreciate his talent nor his putrid existence by putting a paper plate telling the town to go fuck itself .
Not even disclosed by Gateway or even on the organizers bland website for the money pissing bargain of $ 200 or $ 250 dollars a night , you can rent a tent on the sand with encroaching and unpredictable tides and sleep in a queen size bed with rugs and furniture .
The message can ’ t be more transparent , they need to get the fuck out for the good of society and humankind .
Prospect Park is surrounded by luxury towers completed and currently developed , overvalued speculative property rates and two way bike lanes , Bensonhurst Park is surrounded by Bensonhurst , a town that is populated with working class families and individuals that doesn ’ t seem to be on the real estate industry radar or even of interest of leisure and style sections of the elite newspapers and fashion magazines ( and the citizenry there probably don ’ t give a shit not to be included in such focus features ) .
Why should they since they didn ’ t even spend a penny to equip Bensonhurst park with a shit shovel , cleaning supplies or even a broom .
His victim , John Jolly , is a mentally ill homeless man who once served time on a rape conviction .
Also in Times Square at the DoubleTree hotel , a girl was molested by a man with prior lewdness charges against him , as he rubbed his genitals up her back side while her family was not looking .
In the Lower East Side , a luxury hotel recently opened directly across the street from a Section 8 program apartment building has seen a consistent spate of their patrons having sex in full view in front of their floor to ceiling windows to the annoyance and disgust of the residents of the real affordable housing building .
Also in Sunnyside on the 7 train , a shirtless blob of a man rubbed his genitals on a woman who happened to be an off-duty cop and ran out at the 40th street station .
stations in West Farms , an 84-year-old man pulled out his penis and masturbated in full view of 3 children .
In Eltingville , a stupid fucking idiot was caught riding his motorcycle with a baby that wasn ’ t harnessed to him and without a license .
Fortunately for him , the new decriminalization laws , even for this bullshit charge , kept him from going to Rikers .
This is a city where people who pay taxes have to live , commute , and work in , raise a family in , not a fucking goddamn borough spanning film studio .
And most of all , there is no room in this town anymore for this bullshit .
The worst fucking transit system in the universe and a never ending and rising homeless epidemic .
He has no concept of priorities at all and like when he ran HUD in the late 90 ’ s ( with de Blasio under him by the way ) , spends and reallocates money that doesn ’ t belong to him like an idiot asshole .
Just a pissing contest .
I take the stance that it ’ s mutually assured destruction , especially with things like NATO and so many countries still being tied up in alliances is just , you know , we ’ re repeating that mistake again from history , but I think , I don ’ t think anyone is going to use nukes like that because as soon as one person does it , everyone ’ s going to have to do it to retaliate and then the world is gone .
So to summarize where we are right now , the United States has spent 60 years pissing off the people of the middle East .
Which sucks .
Facebook is a stupid time suck , let ’ s be honest .
Document 1 : LGBTQ people 's mistreatment in prison The particular example of gay acceptance in the US army today Don ’ t Ask , Don ’ t Tell Enacted in 1994 , the US « Don ’ t Ask , Don ’ t Tell » policy prevented military officers from asking service members about their sexual orientation while homosexual service members were not allowed to talk about their sexual orientation .
However , things got violent and her boyfriend began raping her on several occasions before they split up in November 2012 , the lawsuit claims .
She says she began talking to school officials—several teachers and a school psychologist—in March 2013 about the rape , but none of them suggested she should go to police with this information .
One teacher explained rape culture to the young woman and said police would n't believe her story , advising her to talk to friends but not go to police about the incident , according to the lawsuit .
She says that even though she asked the teacher to help her tell administrators about the rape , the teacher did n't .
It was n't until January 2014 , over six months after she graduated , that her ex-boyfriend 's parents told her parents that the school 's vice principal went to her ex-boyfriend 's house to talk to his family about the rape allegations , the suit says .
TELL ME YOU LOVE ME is supposed to be oh-so-racy , raw and edgy…but the show is so ponderously dull and heavy-handed that even the sex scenes are boring .
A very clever friend of mine had the best comment about the sex scenes : They ’ re so bad I can watch them with my wife .
Wow , if this show didn ’ t ever miss its audience… It seems to have divided people into two camps : Those who think that it is disgusting that it has too much sex in it .
And those who don ’ t think that there is enough sex/that the sex in it isn ’ t sexy enough .
The pace of it is a little slow , and the sex certainly isn ’ t showy or superficial .
But , you know , we ’ ve got the internet for porn , if we want it , and the other shows we ’ re watching at the moment are so hyperactive that the change of pace is fine , when we fancy it .
What I find a little disingenious , though , is that the show ’ s creator is claiming that she didn ’ t consider the sex as unusual or likely to cause a stir at all .
I understand why aesthetically or creatively one might choose to approach the sex frankly and without artifice .
But to pretend you don ’ t know that full-frontal nudity and shots of apparent penetration aren ’ t going to draw all the wrong kinds of attention is false .
When Michael Winterbottom made “ 9 Songs ” , I doubt very much he tried to claim that he didn ’ t know how far he was pushing audience sensibilities with the genuine sex scenes .
I tend to think the show isn ’ t really aimed at the porn crowd , and if it is being marketed as sexy in the US , it is being marketed badly .
So whatever , she lied to cover her ass , probably not the last HR person in the world to do that — and , definitely NOT the first .
I was thinking we could get by with the previous three qualities , but when I took another look , I realized you can be honest , brave , and curious and still be a real asshole .

In the long and glorious annals of Washington sex scandals , U.S. Rep. Christopher Lee has truly made history .
It was , in many respects , a sex scandal completely defined by the Internet era : Lee answered an online ad , sent some cheesy e-mails and a laughable beefcake photo to the woman ( “ I promise not to disappoint , ” he boasted ) , and since he used his own name , the woman discovered that he was a married congressman simply by Googling him .

A night with Nikki… Taaliah · February 27 , 2014 · Random ramblings of a busy brain ... · Call Girl , Escort Agency , Escorts , Manchester , prostitution , sex for sale , sex worker · One Comment Smart , funny and exceptionally witty , Nikki looks much younger than her 35 years .
She is also an escort and spends her evenings having sex with men for cash .
With so much in the news recently about the rise of girls forced into prostitution , Nikki is eager to lift the lid on the other side of this often-misunderstood profession – where , for some , selling sex is a choice and not a necessity .
“ I sell sex because the money is good , the hours are flexible and to be honest , I ’ m really good at it .
I made the choice to become an escort and I ’ ve never really looked back , finally I can support myself and have a pretty decent standard of living at the same time. ” Married for a number of years , Nikki says she was ‘ happy with her lot ’ and looking forward to possibly having children one day , until her husband had an affair , eventually leaving her for a much younger woman he had allegedly met at work .
“ I was really nervous and didn ’ t have a clue what to wear so I went for what was , in my opinion , sexy and appropriate – an incredibly short skirt and staggeringly high heels .
“ Don ’ t dress like a hooker , don ’ t do anything unprotected , do not try and undercut the other girls and never give out your personal phone number. ” Nikki certainly doesn ’ t fit the stereotypical image you would imagine for a ‘ hooker ’ - dressed in a blouse , fitted jeans and designer jacket she would look more at home in a boardroom than on any street corner .
As she says herself , “ Most of the time you would never know I was an escort .
One evening he called the agency , booked me for the whole night and we arrived at his farm house in the countryside by private helicopter to enjoy partying into the early hours. ” When I ask about the sex aspect of the deal Nikki shrugs it off as a very small , occasionally enjoyable part of her unusual job .
Smelly ones are dealt with by offering to shower with them and to be honest , most of the guys are alright really. ” “ It turns me on to know that this man is paying me for my time , for my body – I have a high sex drive so it suits me just fine .

“ Don ’ t fucking tell me what to do. ” “ If I didn ’ t tell you what to do , you ’ d never do anything , ” I told her .

But I just like her , mostly because she ’ s just sexy .

Florida teacher wo n't face charges for showing R-rated film HomeFlorida teacher wo n't face charges for showing R-rated film NICEVILLE , Fla. ( AP ) – A sheriff ’ s investigation refutes allegations that a Florida Panhandle teacher subjected her students to pornography by letting them watch the R-rated movie „ Alexander. ” Parents of a 15-year-old girl told school officials she was traumatized by the Niceville High School teacher showing students a movie that they considered to be „ porn. ” But Okaloosa County Sheriff´s officials said there was no probable cause to bring charges against the teacher .
The 2004 Oliver Stone movie stars Colin Farrell as ancient Greek king Alexander the Great.It contains nudity and scenes of sexual assault and homosexuality .
At the time , the girl was absent from school for two days and used her teacher ’ s password to access an account and watch the movie from home , the newspaper reported.The couple and their daughter then watched the graphic scenes they later described to the Okaloosa County School Board as pornography .

§ 4248 , which “ authorizes the federal government to civilly commit , in a federal facility , any ‘ sexually dangerous ’ person ‘ in the custody ’ of the Bureau of Prisons — even after that person has completed his entire prison sentence. ” The Eighth Circuit has now reached the opposite result , and a circuit split on the constitutionality of a federal statute is almost certain to lead to Supreme Court review .
Moreover , like the petitioner in Greenwood , federal power over Tom has not yet been exhausted for he was sentenced to a 60 month term of supervised release which had yet to begin at the time he was certified as a sexually dangerous person .
First , the Supreme Court “ ha [ s ] never required Congress to legislate with scientific exactitude. ” Second , even were “ exactitude ” required , the Adam Walsh Act civil commitment provision applies to a restricted universe of individuals -– those who have been charged with or convicted of a federal crime , see § 4248 ( a ) , and “ have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation , ” see § 4247 ( a ) ( 6 ) — who because of the nature of their proclivities are likely to commit federal crimes .
A propensity to engage in sexually violent conduct or child molestation can hardly be disassociated from the likelihood that a person may commit other types of sex related crimes that fall within federal jurisdiction , such as those involving internet child pornography , see 18 U.S.C .
§ 2252 , or the use of the internet to solicit sexual activity from a minor , see 18 U.S.C .
As a Senate report indicates , by one estimate more than 50 % of child molesters possessed child pornography at the time of arrest… .
While we are mindful of the fact that “ Congress , unlike the legislatures of the states , can not sanction for the general welfare , ” § 4248 appears to be “ aimed at preventing the specific harm to the community proscribed by the [ federal sex crime ] statutes. ” ( Hide excerpt . )

“ As I reached puberty , these feelings became part of my sexuality and I experienced some gender dysphoria , but I was also attracted to women so it was confusing .
Having friends who think the rules of gender are bullshit is one thing , and having friends who think the rules of gender are awesome but they sometimes don ’ t match one ’ s personal body is another .
I was holding my shoulders in and my butt out and doing all sorts of things that were outside the natural movement of my body .
It sometimes can be difficult to be critical in any way of trans issues in that environment , but I am interested in helping people work with their dysphoria in whatever way possible. ” The tricky part of that is that “ promoting and supporting trans rights ” has evolved into meaning treating gender dysphoria as literally being the alternative sex , as opposed to meaning helping people work with their dysphoria in whatever way possible .
But I think some people do have actual physical dysphoria and are happier if they get a physical sex change , and in that case should be allowed to do so and should be accepted as being the sex they have physically changed to .
@ Anna # 1 But I think some people do have actual physical dysphoria and are happier if they get a physical sex change , and in that case should be allowed to do so and should be accepted as being the sex they have physically changed to .
I ’ m not Ophelia , but I wish to point out that “ should be allowed to [ get surgery ] ” and “ be accepted as the sex they have physically changed to ” should not be tied together like that .
In the second place , people can ’ t really change sex , so it matters what precisely you mean when you say “ accepted as the sex they have changed into. ” There ’ s an ontological problem there , and it ’ s not trivial .
as people who choose to live as if they were the other sex .
Perhaps because aided by the fact that ‘ protagonist ’ had heavily overlap with ‘ male. ’ The tricky part of that is that “ promoting and supporting trans rights ” has evolved into meaning treating gender dysphoria as literally being the alternative sex , as opposed to meaning helping people work with their dysphoria in whatever way possible .
And even more drastic are the ones that treat having hobbies/interests/personality traits more stereotypical of the other sex as literally being that other sex .
as people who choose to live as if they were the other sex .
” Ok , I can get behind “ she ’ s a transgender woman ” rather than “ she ’ s a woman ” for someone who ’ s had hormones , sex change surgery , etc .

A federal jury on Wednesday convicted R. Kelly of several child pornography and sex abuse charges in his hometown of Chicago , delivering another legal blow to a singer who used to be one of the biggest R & B stars in the world .
( AP Photo/Matt Marton ) CHICAGO – Federal prosecutors this week scored multiple convictions against R. Kelly at the singer ’ s trial in Chicago , but they lost on the headline charge — that Kelly obstructed justice by rigging his 2008 state child pornography trial , at which jurors acquitted him .
Kelly , 55 , is already serving a 30-year prison term imposed by a federal judge in New York for racketeering and sex trafficking .
“ But in this case , '' said Phil Turner , a former federal prosecutor in Chicago , `` the facts just weren ’ t there. ” Jurors also acquitted Kelly of receiving child pornography and one count of producing child pornography .
He was convicted of producing child pornography and enticing girls for sex .
The claim was that Kelly and McDavid conspired to ensure key witnesses at the 2008 trial would lie about Kelly ’ s sexual abuse of girls and refuse to testify .
Witnesses at the just-ended trial described their frantic scramble to recover lost Kelly videos of himself sexually abusing girls .
State and federal prosecutors said she was the girl Kelly is seen sexually abusing on a VHS tape that was at the heart of the 2008 trial .
Jane and her parents said they lied to a grand jury in the early 2000s about Kelly ’ s sexual abuse , and they did n't testify at the 2008 trial .
For the child pornography count , the evidence included video that jurors saw .

The researchers focused particularly on common routes of sexual transmission of viruses , such as the lower female reproductive tract and the lower gastrointestinal tract that includes the large intestine and the anus .
To conduct the study , Sanjabi and her team created a new model of viral infection through the rectum that uses lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus ( LCMV ) , a rodent virus often used in research to model other pathogens .
They also noticed that the virus stayed in the vagina and did n't spread to other parts of the body .
In contrast , the new study indicates that , after infection through the rectum , the virus rapidly spreads throughout the body .
These findings have general implications for the mechanism of sexual transmission and dissemination of many viruses , including HIV and Zika .

Han initially looked puzzled when a viewer said he “ kept masturbating , although he was married , and even during the Umrah , ” a pilgrimage to Mecca performed by Muslims which can be undertaken at any time of the year , in contrast to the Hajj .
After repeating the question a few times , Han claimed that Islam strictly prohibits masturbation as a “ haram ” ( forbidden ) act .

Reflecting the same sense that attitudes are socially constructed and can impact reproductive decision-making , the Committee on the Rights of the Child has repeatedly expressed its concern regarding sex selective screening and abortion and , trenchantly , has recommended to States parties within the context of State reporting that studies be undertaken to “ determine the socio-cultural factors which lead to practices such as female infanticide and selective abortions , and develop strategies to address them ” ( Committee on the Rights of the Child , Concluding Observations India , para .
This analysis appears to align with the understanding of discrimination adopted by the CRC Committee in the context of sex selective screening practices where the Committee noted that “ [ d ] iscrimination against girl children is a serious violation of rights , affecting their survival and all areas of their young lives as well as restricting their capacity to contribute positively to society ” and , further , that girl children “ may be victims of selective abortion , genital mutilation , neglect and infanticide , including through inadequate feeding in infancy ” ( CRC Committee , General Comment No .
All forms of discrimination against the girl child and the root causes of son preference , which result in harmful and unethical practices such as prenatal sex selection and infanticide ; this is often compounded by the increasing use of the necologoesi to determine foetal sex , resulting in abortion of female fetus ( Beijing Platform for Action , 1995 , para .

These services include sexual and reproductive health , prevention of additional disabilities , and health-related rehabilitation .
The observation by commentators that sex selection leads to invasive medical interventions in the absence of therapeutic indications and contributes to gender stereotypes that could result in child neglect of the lesser-desired sex ( Nachigall , 2010 ) is resonant with concerns by the disability community that disability-selective screening poses risks for the kind of stereotyping that the CRPD aims to combat .

Poverty and grief-stricken , hungry , teary-eyed , malnourished , displaced and victims of sexual violence are the imageries of women and children afflicted by wars .
Coulter claims that women showed themselves “ as capable as men ” in performing violent acts such as mutilation , branding , and sexual violence .
Therefore the behaviour of violent women is explained by “ maternalism , mental instability or deviant sexuality ” .
Lastly , the ‘ whores ’ narrative focuses on the woman ’ s sexuality as a reason for their violent actions .
Sjoberg and Gentry argue that a woman ’ s violent behaviour is due to her “ insatiable need for sex with men , men ’ s control and ownership of their bodies , or their inability to have sex with men ” .
The third stereotype that I have taken up is : “ women can only be at the receiving end of sexual violence whereas men are largely immune ” which is a typically gendered narrative of conflicts .
Though it is undeniable that sexual violence against women is at a far higher number and is more prevalent , sexual violence committed against men and boys in contexts of armed conflicts usually goes unnoticed .
An explanation for this can be derived from the stereotyped notions of a woman ’ s ‘ passivity ’ and ‘ weakness ’ that pins them down as the perpetual victim of sexual violence .
The gender norms concerning masculinity serve as an obstruction to recognize sexual violence against men .
Lewis ( 2007 ) defines sexual violence against males as “ a complex psycho-social process in which homosexual and/or feminine attributes are designated to the male survivor .
Men being on the receiving end of sexual violence supposedly emasculates and humiliates them thus leaving them at the bottom of the societal power structure .
Furthermore , the societal notion of sexual violence primarily being perpetrated against women further provides reason to the under-reporting of sexual violence against men .
Further , the abuse that men suffer during armed conflicts are largely viewed as beatings or torture , but it important to acknowledge that sexual violence should be included in these forms of abuse .
It is imperative to recognize the ongoing prevalence of sexual violence against males .
Further research and awareness about this subject can help eliminate the stereotype of women solely as victims of sexual violence and men only as perpetrators .
Furthermore , the prevalence of sexual violence against men during conflict has also been discussed .
If so , then you could be suffering from anxiety that , if left to run its course , could end up snowballing into a lifetime of chronic illness .

June 27 , 2010 at 9:13 pm ( Catholicism , Champagne Charlie , Christianity , religion ) Vatican taken by surprise over Belgium police raids By David Willey BBC News , Rome The police raid in Belgium last week which broke up a meeting of the country ’ s Catholic Bishops – who were discussing how to deal with the paedophile priest crisis – took the Vatican by complete surprise .

It would ban almost all abortions in the state , without exceptions for rape and incest , and subject abortion providers to harsh criminal penalties , but the Roberts court tends toward incrementalism , and is not likely to want to take on a direct confrontation with that precedent .
As her question hung in the air between us , I knew immediately that she had read the news that our home state , Ohio , had just banned nearly all abortions with no exceptions for rape or incest .
The likelihood of rape is also high .
I was devastated , emotionally wrecked , not only because I had been raped but because I was pregnant with my rapist ’ s child .
It was her first sexual experience .
I did not want to give a baby away and I did not want to raise my rapist ’ s child .
Even if I wanted to give birth to my rapist ’ s baby — which I did not — I , like so many others , could not turn to my family for help .
I recall some male law students arguing that abortion bans wouldn ’ t be so bad , so long as there were exceptions made in cases of rape .
I wondered how a “ rape exception ” to an abortion ban could possibly help women , like me , who did not want to report a rape to the police and who could not possibly prove that a rape occurred if the man denied it .
Would abortions be allowed based on mere allegations of rape without any proof ?
What man would admit to rape knowing that he ’ d face a likely prison sentence ?
I doubt if he would ’ ve done the same if I ’ d been legally required to report the rape to obtain an abortion .
My rapist called the day after he violated me and left an awkward message on my answering machine saying he was sorry about “ what happened. ” He did not use the word “ rape. ” He asked me to call him back .

Previously , Argentine law allowed abortion in cases when the mother ’ s life or health was in danger , or in cases of rape .
The former senator requested the prohibition of “ the medical or clinical surgical practice of abortion ” with the exception of those grounds that allow abortion in cases of rape or danger to the life or integral health of the mother .
But Satana ’ s overlooked contribution to the finer arts may be the lessons in shaking and lovemaking she claims to have given Elvis Presley after an encounter in a State Street strip club circa 1955 .

She first appeared nude in an act called “ Galatea , the Statue That Came to Life ” at , as she later described it , the “ sleazy ” Rendezvous Club in Calumet City .

Except here 's why he 's completely and utterly wrong : The Employment NonDiscrimination Act simply takes away employers ' ( with more than 15 employees ) right to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity , the same way similar protections prevent bias on the basis of skin color , race , sex , national origin , or yes -- RELIGION .

How to hit your G-Spot for more mind-blowing orgasms There are thousands of nerve endings in the vagina , and the G-Spot—that elusive patch of sensitive tissue inside the vagina—is like a sanctuary of some of the best ones .
When stimulated properly , the G-Spot can leave you in an earthshattering , do it again ( and again , please ) vaginal orgasm .
This area can also lead to female ejaculation ( yes , guys , you aren ’ t the only ones ) .
The G-Spot , or Gräfenberg spot , is a highly sensitive erogenous zone located inside the vagina a few inches from the opening along the upper wall ( toward the belly button ) .
It can become engorged during arousal and can often lead to intense feelings of pleasure , orgasm , and female ejaculation when touched .
Thankfully , a group of researchers has cleared the air by studying the complex anatomy and sexual responses of women .
In their study , they found that the G-Spot is most likely a connection to the clitoris , that tiny , super-sensitive pea-sized point located where the inner labia meet .
The study found that the clit extended below the labia with two wishbone-like legs reaching into the interior of the vagina .
During arousal , blood flows to your G-Spot , and much like a penis , it can expand and grow the more turned on you are .
So before digging right in , give yourself a sexy tease first .
Once you ’ re hot and bothered , slip your fingers into the opening of your vagina and bend them forward in a “ come here ” motion .
You can try rubbing or stroking , sliding your fingers in or out , or placing pressure on it while you stimulate your outer clit .
For even better stimulation , enlist the help of your favorite G-Spot vibrator .
Using a G-Spot Vibrator Whether you ’ re having a difficult time finding your G-Spot or just want to make things more fun , consider using a G-Spot vibrator .
Ideally , you should look for a vibrator that offers multiple levels of power .
For an even more earthshattering feel , invest in a vibrator that offers dual stimulation .
Dual stimulation offers a secondary head that stimulates your clit while simultaneously applying the perfect pressure to your G-Spot .
Stimulating both areas is key if you want to experience a “ blended orgasm , ” where your body reaches climax both vaginally and clitorally at the same time , leading to one hell of a delicious experience .
Many women who have struggled to properly trigger their G-Spot through sex or traditional masturbation have often been able to achieve intense vaginal orgasms using a G-Spot vibrator .
This can make it easier for you to become turned and to orgasm from partner penetration .
If you ’ re looking for a vibrator that can help you stimulate all of your erogenous zones and bring you more powerful , intense orgasms , invest in the Iridescence by Indulgent Moments .
This vibrator was built with everything a woman could ask for—12 powerful vibration settings , three intensities , and two pleasure points to give you the ultimate double-arousal you won ’ t be able to get enough of .
Order your Iridenscence vibrator today and start giving yourself the kind of self-care you ’ ll want to practice over and over again .

I have a little experience with this and am curious what percentage of parents are out there who 's children have sexually offended and they feel paralyzed by their inability to talk to anyone about their experience because this topic is just not socially acceptable .
Hello J. , Parents who email with questions about sex offenders usually have some suspicion that their child is engaging in this activity …they just don ’ t have any solid evidence yet .
In the U.S. , 15 to 33 percent of all sex offenses are committed by persons under 21 years of age .
Males represent approximately 90 % of adult and adolescent sex offenders reported to authorities .
Victims of sexual dating violence or acquaintance rape , or male victims of female offenders often do not define their experience as sexual assault or abuse , therefore do not report it .
Some victims are just too young , developmentally delayed , or immature to realize they were sexually assaulted or sexually abused .
Adolescent sex offenders rarely disclose their abusing behavior or refer themselves to treatment .
Many parents also do not report incidents of incest between siblings or other members of the family .

There ’ s an added element of mother-daughter bonding that occurs in a threesome ( i.e. , the whole family spending time together ) that would not occur otherwise .
In addition to the behavior of releasing waste in improper places , a child with encopresis may have other symptoms , including loss of appetite , abdominal pain , loose stools , scratching or rubbing the anal area due to irritation from watery stools , decreased interest in physical activity , withdrawal from friends and family , and secretive behavior associated with bowel movements .
This may occur for several reasons , including stress , not drinking enough water and pain caused by a sore in or near the anus .
When a child is constipated , a large mass of feces develops , which stretches the rectum .
This stretching dulls the nerve endings in the rectum , and the child may not feel the need to go to the bathroom or know that waste is coming out .
Eventually , the muscles that keep stool in the rectum can no longer hold it back .
Because of the soft nature of this fecal material , dinosaur droppings would often disintegrate before they had a chance to fossilize .

The poorly-worded email goes on to claim that the user 's computer has been infected with a Remote Access Trojan ( which the email calls a `` Remote Desktop '' ) from a pornography website and that videos of the user watching explicit videos have been recorded .
The email also claims that the user ’ s contacts from email and social networking have been gathered and that unless a sum of money is paid ( in Bitcoin , of course ) , the video of the user watching porn will be sent to those contacts .
The contradiction that porn is both widely popular yet taboo in many areas certainly increases the potential of success for this campaign as well .
Where the attack falls short , however , is mainly in the poor grammar ( which is a common sign of any phishing-based scam ) , the age of the password list being used ( since it 's possible the password provided is no longer in use ) , and relying on a gamble that the user has , in fact , been to a porn site recently .

In New York City , the rise in “ hate crimes ” ( crimes perpetrated because of someone ’ s race , religion or sexual persuasion ) has caused Governor Andrew Cuomo to create a special police unit in the NYPD to counteract such incidences .

Roughan was quoted in an interview with the Arrange last week , offering a somewhat shallower endorsement of the drama ’ s message : “ When I read Henry Vshe said , “ I thought , ‘ Holy shit , this is the pinnacle of English mythology and white supremacy , and toxic masculinity. ’ I felt like I had discovered the dirty , murky roots of English nationalism .
Haplodiploidy determines the sex in all members of the insect orders Hymenoptera ( bees , ants , and wasps ) [ 2 ] and Thysanoptera ( 'thrips ' ) .
In this system , sex is determined by the number of sets of chromosomes an individual receives .
This means the workers in such monogamous single-queen colonies are significantly more closely related than in other sex determination systems where the relatedness of siblings is usually no more than 1⁄2 .
In an X0 sex-determination system , males and females receive an equal number of autosomes , but when it comes to sex chromosomes , females will receive two X chromosomes while males will receive only a single X chromosome .
Since hymenopteran mother and sons share the same genes , they may be especially sensitive to inbreeding : Inbreeding reduces the number of different sex alleles present in a population , hence increasing the occurrence of diploid males .
[ 7 ] Social bees , wasps , and ants can modify sex ratios within colonies which maximizes relatedness among members and generates a workforce appropriate to surrounding conditions .
[ 13 ] Sex determination in honey bees is initially due to a single locus , called the complementary sex determiner ( csd ) gene .
[ 18 ] Sex determination in chalcidoid waspsEdit In wasps of the genus Nasonia , a non-CSD method of sex determination has been documented .
In normal sexual reproduction , the father has two sets of chromosomes , and crossing over takes place between the chromatids of each pair during the meiosis which produces the sperm .

: The idea that socialism is first and foremost about freedom and therefore about overcoming the domination , repression , and alienation that block the free flow of human creativity , thought , and action .
Libertarian socialism , furthermore , does not limit its aims to democratic control by producers over production , but seeks to abolish all forms of domination and hierarchy in every aspect of social and personal life , an unending struggle , since progress in achieving a more just society will lead to new insight and understanding of forms of oppression that may be concealed in traditional practice and consciousness .
This result was independent of sex of participant and consistent with the theory .
At the interface of social cognition and psychometrics : Manipulating the sex of the reference class modulates sex differences in personality traits 2013 Psychometric surveys suggest that sex differences in personality are minimal .
Herein , we argue that ( a ) the mind is likely biased toward assessing oneself relative to same-sex others , and ( b ) this bias may affect the measurement of sex differences in personality .
In support of this , an experiment demonstrates modulation of sex differences on the HEXACO facets by manipulating the sex of the “ reference class ” —the group of people subjects compare themselves to when making self-assessments on survey items .
Although patterns varied across traits , sex differences were relatively small in the “ unspecified ” and “ same-sex ” reference class conditions—but substantially larger in the “ opposite-sex ” condition .
These findings point to a same-sex comparison bias that may impact the measurement of sex differences in personality .
To these feats were added Grazia Chiuri ’ s pragmatic pieces and several bras , a product that sticks to the new sexy trend .

A song about `` really fucking wanting to fuck , ” `` It '' expresses that it 's important to not only have more visible women in the arts – especially in genres of traditionally `` dude music '' – but also to explicitly address female sexual desires .

Miriam ’ s genealogy was perfect , and when you consider that anyone from the Davidic bloodline can be chosen as the Mashiach by G-d , and that Yeshua was entirely made of Miriam ’ s DNA even though the sex was altered , you have a fully Davidic King .
It is set in contrasts , laughter and crying , laughter and memories of traces of tears and then , somewhat confusing sighs ; references to an orgy ( probably not of the sexual variety but involving overabundant exuberance ) that generates deep sighs ; and then , a symbolic contrast between briny ocean waters , perhaps reminiscent of the reference to crying and tears in the other two stanza , and the formation of pearls , perhaps a symbol of purity , but perhaps not .
While there has been lurid speculation about Silva ’ s sexuality , many believe that there was one major love in his life and that “ Juntos los dos ” may have been a reference to his relationship with Isabel Argáez Ferro .
Amid the orgy of the calid cups , deep long sighs are born and in the oceans ’ briny depths , pure pallid pearls take form !

Here ’ s what he confirmed is how an unborn child develops in the womb : Science says that at conception the hair color , eye color , and sex of the child has already been determined .

authentic , body image , marriage problems , sexual intimacy struggles , Uncategorized I have been thinking about this question , “ Who is having the best sex ? ” A lot of the media coverage as of late has been on the Super Bowl .
Maybe those gals are having great sex ; maybe they are not .
What I am trying to illuminate is that the vast majority of married folk out there having the best sex are people who look like everyday people .
All things considered , can you grasp that stunning physical beauty is not what makes sex great ?
Beautiful people do not have a corner on the “ great sex ” market because of their physical beauty .
For many women , that body image struggle takes a huge toll on sexual intimacy in their marriage .
And most of the world that is having great sex are people who look like you and me .
Wives , if you know that body image is a stumbling block in your sexual intimacy , I beg of you to take a hard realistic look at that struggle — and to find a way to be more tender with yourself .
What makes sex great is our willingness to live in our skin , grow in our sexual confidence and seek health and beauty that is not measured against someone who has unlimited access to trainers , chefs , make-up artistic and wardrobe specialists .
Tom and his team just lost the Super Bowl , so for Tom and Gisele ’ s sake , I hope they have some comfort sex soon .
What I am doing is trying to shed light on the ways that we often sabotage sexual intimacy in our marriages by being our own worst enemies .
We toss poisonous arrows across our marriage bed like , “ I don ’ t want my husband to see me naked ” and “ I hate my body ” and “ I simply can ’ t enjoy sex. ” Who is having the best sex ?
Who is having the best sex ?
The married couples who have learned that phenomenal sexual intimacy is built not on society ’ s standards of beauty , but on the respect , love , passion and adoration they nurture in their own covenant .
Statistically speaking , most of the amazing sex happening in marriages is happening between people who look like you and me .
Having great sex .
When I feel happy with the way I look and believe the words that my husband is continually telling me…our relationship and sex life is so much better .
I always thought married women who are highly attractive have less sex ( compared to the average looking woman ) .
Most highly attractive women are selfish divas and are “ gatekeepers ” in the sexual relationship with their spouse .
In 1980 , however , Notley made a series of erotic collages that juxtapose photographs of nude women from pornographic magazines on six-and-a-half-by-eleven inch placards that announce diner-style daily food specials .
Another announces “ Broiled Flounder ” with a nude woman , seemingly in ecstasy , sunning beneath the text .
Notley references the Special To-day collages in her poem “ Hematite Heirloom Lives On ( Maybe December 1980 ) ” in the book Mysteries of Small Houses ( 1998 ) , suggesting their connections to gender , sexuality , and loss : I may be making erotic art near the red telephone that connects Ted to his mother dying of cancer I cut out photos of nude women and place them on food signs Chicken Pot Pie .
Why — because I want to save the women in the photos , so make them humor-filled or truly connected to the fountainhead of sex as I imagine it .
[ 9 ] As Notley suggests , the Special To-day series is a recuperative aesthetic project that reinscribes new forms of sexual autonomy .
The collages emphasize women ’ s bodies as objects of consumption — overtly so in their appearance on “ food signs ” — in such a way that the incongruity of the altered images and text uncouple the nude women from their original pornographic context .
Disserved in mysterious and strange erotic alignments , adjectives like “ hot , ” “ delicious , ” and “ pure , ” which appear on many of the food placards , become free-floating language .
They are funny and forceful works that , like Notley ’ s poems in Waltzing Matilda ( 1981 ) , are full of the tensions of motherhood , love , sexuality , and domesticity within an energized aesthetic life .
There are narratives embedded across the range of her work , whether in the flowers that permeate nearly every piece , the uncompromising attention to gender and sexuality , or the personal network of symbols that one sees emerging in tandem with her poetry .

Set in the Wild West early days of the Internet , Pam & Tommy is based on the true story of the Pamela Anderson ( Lily James ) and Tommy Lee ( Sebastian Stan ) sex tape .
A slick and fast-paced show , Pam & Tommy explores its subject through a Me Too lens that doesn ’ t always hits the right spots but somehow manages to be insightful and creates a nuanced story that tries to showcase how one sex tape changed the lives of so many .
This is a show that , just like everyone who purchased and watched the infamous sex tape , takes advantage of a woman ’ s trauma for their own benefit .
The interplay between the two leads , in particular , was devoid of sexual tension made up for by a type of near sexless dominant/submissive relationship , where the wife calls the shots , her ambition outpaced by her husband ’ s disinterest in strategic mind games .
Their concerns were laid to rest somewhat when the young man pointed to a small brown pile in a yard and proclaimed , “ Look , its scat ! ” He went on to explain to his parents that “ scat ” was just another word for poop .
Sigh… This conversation brought back memories of a gift my clever mother got her grandson one year , a book containing everything you would ever need to know about animal scat .

Acosta , then a U.S. attorney in Florida , oversaw a sweetheart deal for Epstein , which required him to register as a sex offender and sentenced him to 13 months in prison .

The expert pointed out that the term “ sexual orientation ” is about “ how we feel towards others and it ’ s an external dimension of what we are , while gender identity is the internal dimension of what we are , which may be different in terms of identity from the gender or sex assigned at birth .
Credit : Amy Fallon / IPS All people have sexual orientation and gender identity ( SOGI ) , he reminded , “ But SOGI are part of everyone .
In his work plan , Muntarbhorn will emphasise “ five areas interrelated and mutually reinforcing that are instrumental in the protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. ” “ These linchpins are : decriminalisation , destigmatization , legal recognition of gender Identity , cultural inclusion with gender and sexual diversity and empathization. ” On decriminalisation , the expert said , “ I think that there are 70 countries now that still criminalize and five to seven that still give the death penalty .
” A 2015 ILGA report shows “ Same-sex sexual acts – death penalty ( 13 States [ or parts of ] ) , six per cent of United Nation States. ” “ Death penalty for same-sex sexual behaviour codified under Sharia ( Islamic law ) and implemented countrywide ( 4 ) : Africa : Sudan .
The death penalty for same-sex sexual behaviour codified under Sharia but not known to be implemented for same-sex behaviour specifically ( 5 ) : Africa : Mauritania .
Death penalty for same-sex sexual behaviour codified under Sharia implemented by local courts/vigilantes/non-State actors ( 2 ) : Asia : Iraq and Daesh ( ISIS / ISIL ) -held territories in northern Iraq and northern Syria .
Muntarbhorn noted that “ there are also cases of countries where there may be a law criminalizing same sex relationships , affecting particularly gays .
The legal recognition and gender identity is very much linked with trans persons as well as intersex persons to some extent , because trans persons want to have their identity recognized legally even though it may be a different identity from their sex at birth .
“ But in other situations we have the negative traditional practices that kill , that harm , that persecute people who are different in terms of sexual orientation and gender identity. ” Muntarbhor found “ that happens in many communities , including some application of certain interpretation of religious laws , as well as the remnants of colonial laws that used to criminalize these relationships. ” About the term of the “ empathization , ” the expert explained that he uses it “ meaning nurturing empathy , a certain understanding , self-understanding , for other people so that we are humans. ” “ And this means attitude , it means knowledge , it means mindset , and it ’ s to do with education , but more than education .
It ’ s to do with socialization , it ’ s to do with linking up with families , communities , from a young age , so that we feel empathy , a certain understanding of those who are different from us in terms of gender and sexual diversity , ” Muntarbhor concluded .

JURY RECOMMENDS DEATH PENALTY FOR MAN LINKED THROUGH DNA TO 1988 COLD CASE SEXUAL ASSAULT-MURDER OF YOUNG PREGNANT NEWLYWED SANTA ANA – A jury recommended the death penalty today for a man convicted of the 1988 cold case sexual assault-murder of a pregnant 22-year-old newlywed after being linked to the crime through DNA .

Platy Enterprises Ltd. , the Supreme Court of Canada concluded that : “ … sexual harassment in the workplace may be broadly defined as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that detrimentally affects the work environment or leads to adverse job-related consequences for the victims of the harassment. ” Harassment is a form of discrimination .
The best way is to have a work place policy regarding sexual harassment and to educate your employees .
If you feel that you have been subjected to sexual harassment in the work place the first thing you need to do is advise the person who is sexually harassing you that their behaviour is inappropriate .
If you are an employer , you will want to ensure that you have a sexual harassment policy and education program in place to ensure that your employees understand what sexual harassment is .
In fact , the Canadian Human Rights Act gives employees the right to work in an environment that is “ free of sexual harassment ” and requires that employers take proactive measures in that regard .
If you are an employer and do not have a sexual harassment policy in place , you should consult a lawyer to help you prepare and implement such a policy at your workplace .
The part 3 of the free porn game - `` S.L.U.T . ''
The media did not like it because it was not sexy enough for them—it was totally boring for them—but that does not matter because we do not act in this House to please the media , but it worked for us as long as it was .
The exhaustive system takes much longer to do , as you know—I am not teaching my grandmother to suck eggs ; you have looked at this .
He sexuality remains mysterious .
What sort of erotic life he must have had , what sort of dream life , remains entirely mysterious .
There is no such thing as free porn .
Crissy ( iamatreasure.com ) , a former pastor ’ s daughter who grew up to be a porn star and has since returned to a vibrant relationship with Jesus , shares her story and realities of the porn industry .
Those of you on the porn path : Jesus died so you can kill your sin before it kills you .

Porn Practically The US Supreme Court can ’ t even define pornography .
In addition to the hardcore forms , we also are talking about the softcore forms , some of the men ’ s magazines that basically show as much as pornography did just a few generations ago .
And the same is true for the women ’ s magazines , some of them sitting in the grocery store line showing things that a few generations prior would have been tucked away under a shelf not for public viewing , because it would ’ ve qualified for pornography , not to mention the headlines that are shouting even at children .
Sometimes pornography is in an image .
And so many of us have been so desensitized to this , because it is now “ normal. ” That is porn practically .
And with the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 70s , pornography became much more popular .
It became much more graphic , with Hustler and Penthouse pushing the envelope and then others trying to outdo them , so that now there is a real competition to see who can have the most extreme and newest edge of depravity when it comes to pornography .
And what ’ s happened now is pornography is now mainstream , culturally speaking .
You have mainstream pop celebrities making their own sex tapes and distributing their own pornography , and you have those who , as well , have developed their identity and made their living in the porn industry crossing over into the mainstream , doing television shows , mainstream movies , appearing in reality television shows and the like .
And so the line between pornographic culture and pop culture is blurred , if not altogether eliminated , and it ’ s such an industry today that between $ 10 and $ 14 billion a year is spent on pornography .
Additionally , globally , it ’ s a phenomenon often tied to the sex trade and slavery .
Upwards of $ 90 billion a year is spent globally on porn .
And there is no such thing as free porn .
There Is No Such Thing as Free Porn So , you were sexually abused as a little girl .
Porn Chemically What ’ s interesting is the Bible , for thousands of years , has said that lust—and that is the entire purpose in porn and pornography—is sinful , and it ’ s unholy , and it ’ s unhelpful .
And so biopsychologists and others are studying the effects of pornography on your brain and on your body , and that ’ s because pornography really was , in its current form , it was a massive social experiment .
And what we ’ re finding now is that pornography alters the chemistry of the brain .
Like a path that ’ s created in the woods with each successive hiker , so do the neural paths set the course for the next time an erotic image is viewed .
You desire pleasure and the relief that comes ultimately from activities surrounding pornography , and so you venture down that path , so that you might receive that pleasure .
And so if you ’ ve ever known anyone who tried to get off of cocaine or heroin , someone who is deeply addicted to pornography has the same kind of potential struggle .
Because just like the person who is addicted to cocaine or heroin has created for themselves a neural pathway , they ’ ve conditioned their body and reshaped their brain to go down a path for a pleasure , and now it ’ s a well-worn rut , so it is with pornography .
That ’ s why you hear people say that they ’ re addicted to porn in the way that some are addicted to cocaine or addicted to heroin .
Where ’ s the harm ? ” You ’ re literally conditioning your body and re-hardwiring your brain to become addicted to images that you will ultimately prefer over people , such as your spouse , which is the whole point of sex , according to the Bible , in the context of marriage .
He did an interview with Playboy , and in that interview , John Mayer essentially said , “ I now am so addicted to pornography that I prefer pornography to a relationship with a woman. ” He goes on to say in his interview , quote , “ Internet pornography has absolutely changed my generation ’ s expectations. ” What happens when you travel down that pathway for that pleasure is , eventually , like all addicts , you have a hard time living in the real world .
There are endorphins and euphoric highs , that are quite similar to being on drugs , that are released with the pleasure that comes from the ultimate result of the activities that surround pornography .
God created sex and the passions and pleasures associated with it for marriage .
This is where pornography becomes addictive .
He also was a viewer of porn .
I always had this hope inside that there was something better and that I would find the right guy , and I didn ’ t really have high expectations , just , “ Don ’ t cheat on me , don ’ t look at porn , and stay. ” That was it .
And pornography exists to present a menu of options , none of which is your spouse .
Exodus 20:17 , “ Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor ’ s wife. ” You ’ re not supposed to look at someone else and think , “ I wonder what it ’ d be like to be with them. ” If you ’ re not married to them , you have no right to lust after them , to fantasize after them , and that includes pornography , because that ’ s all pornography exists for , to get you to covet , to want someone or something that you do not have .
In pornography , there is payment made .
Some of you are contributing by visiting websites that will advertise free pornography , but at the end of the day , they ’ re sponsored by advertisers , and so there ’ s payment , nonetheless .
But I ’ m saying for those of you who are consumers and purveyors of porn , you ’ re participating in an industry of abuse and assault .
Some of what ’ s made is because of sex trafficking ; some of the women who are even in the industry in the US are often held against their will , threatened , beaten , traumatized , because it ’ s always about the money .
“ We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did , and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day. ” Paul is saying to the church in Corinth , which was an urban church with young people and a very sexualized culture , that even had a temple filled with prostitutes in town as part of illicit worship .
He says—well , the whole argument , from Romans 1:18 through the remainder of the chapter , is all about idolatry in regards to sexuality .
And some of you say , “ Well , how do they do that ? ” Paul goes on to say , through all kinds of sexual sin .
He talks about heterosexual sexual sin , homosexual sexual sin .
And what he ’ s saying is if you worship the creation instead of the Creator , you will find yourself being sexually consumed with sinful passions , because there ’ s nothing more beautiful that God made than the human body .
And the issue goes deeper than just sexual orientation or preference .
You can ’ t simultaneously worship Jesus Christ , the Creator God , and be into porn .
He was addicted to pornography .
First , porn breaks the heart of God .
That ’ s sexual immorality .
There ’ s nothing good that pornography can do for a marriage , nothing .
It ’ s amazing , as Grace and I have done media interviews recently , we ’ ve had multiple non-Christian media outlets just flat out ask , “ Are you saying porn doesn ’ t help a marriage ?
There ’ s nothing good that can come from porn for a marriage ? ” That ’ s exactly what we ’ re saying .
All right , if some guy wanted to marry my daughter , and I asked him , “ What ’ s your plan ? ” and his plan was , “ I ’ m going to look at a lot of porn , so I could be close to your daughter , ” the obvious answer is , “ You can ’ t come near my daughter. ” See , sometimes , when we ’ re sinners , when we think of what we want , we find a way to rationalize , justify , and excuse our behavior .
The guy who watches porn and then pressures his girlfriend or wife to do things that he ’ s seen , that harms the woman .
The result is now we live in a rape culture .
I mean , one in four women is sexually assaulted , raped at some point in their life .
The same is true for one in six men , as well , sexually assaulted at some point in their lifetime .
There was even a news story that was out this week that says children are now raping children .
Oftentimes , those women were molested as children or sexually assaulted by a boyfriend .
Crissy : And I just fell on the floor and just cried , because the porn industry had been a part of every relationship that I was in , and there were numerous men that I ’ ve lived with .
I ’ m in the porn business. ” And then he ’ s like , “ I already knew that. ” And then I said , “ How did you know ? ” And he goes , “ Your boyfriend already told everybody before you ever got here , and he showed your pictures. ” And I was just like—I put my head down .
If you ’ re a guy looking at porn , and you ’ ve already got a daughter , there ’ s a crisis .
Child pornography is still illegal , but available and popular because of the Internet .
And so those who are into pornography oftentimes will end up getting so far down the road that they ’ re interested in child pornography .
And if it ’ s not child pornography , it ’ ll be , quote/unquote , “ barely legal porn. ” A court case not long ago said that it ’ s still illegal to have a child in pornography , but not an adult who looks like a child and is presented as a child .
So , you take women who are barely legal—pigtails , lollipops , school girl outfit , dress her up like a little girl—and then put her in a porno .
The break room had porn everywhere .
The guys would just come and eat lunch and look at porn .
And I just sit in my chair , and I drink beer , and I watch them run around in their pajamas and have pillow fights , and it ’ s like having free porn at my house. ” Don ’ t be that guy .
And then I ’ ve talked to multiple lawyers , and nobody , I mean , nobody feels sorry for the porn star .
So , it ’ s kind of like if you—if you ’ re planning on doing porn , I mean , I highly wouldn ’ t recommend it , but it ’ s never going to go away .
Ninety percent of children , kids ages eight to sixteen , have viewed Internet porn , most accidentally .
How old do you think the average person is when they see their first online porn ?
Who ’ s the number one consumer of online pornography ?
All the porn on the Internet , who ’ s clicking the most ?
That means he is into pornography before he ’ s even biologically approaching manhood .
That means the average guy today is spending four or five years , who knows how many hundreds of hours online , deep , deep down the porn path , and then he finally sleeps with a girl .
That means the average guy , from twelve to twenty-eight , is probably statistically , practically a porn addict , and then he gets a wife .
It is confusing information for them to process , and it also is increasing sexual assault , child on child , as children see things and then do it to one another , not fully understanding everything that is happening .
Some of your parents sat you down , and they said , “ Okay , don ’ t have sex before marriage .
Don ’ t look at porn .
“ Here ’ s what porn is .
Here ’ s what porn does .
Here ’ s what sexual assault is .
Now the works of the flesh are evident : sexual immorality , impurity , sensuality .
The goal is not just to stop looking at porn , but to start worshiping Jesus .
If you start worshiping Jesus , that will help you to stop looking at porn .
“ Here ’ s my first exposure to porn .
Here ’ s my sexual activity , sins I ’ ve committed , sins that have been committed against me .
All right , the first time I saw porn , I was a little boy .
I was never addicted to porn , but I was exposed to porn .
I go downstairs , and they ’ ve got this huge TV , and they ’ ve got a big kitty on top of the TV , and all the guys are encouraged to put money in , because that ’ s the porn fund .
And then they just sit around all day , drink beer , and watch porn .
Some of you think , “ I want to look at porn. ” If you ’ re a Christian , you may want to look at porn , but you really want to honor Jesus .
Amen , and Father God , I feel inclined to pray for the men , the men who are looking at pornography , that their heart would break , Father God , as your heart has been broken , that they would not see just women , but they would see women who are your image bearers , that , God , men ’ s hearts would open up to the reality of the demonic nature of the industry and that they would put to death their sin , and that they would be defenders and protectors of women , that the men , Lord God , who have been giving their money to pornography , and strip clubs , and prostitutes , I pray they would give it to ministries that help women who are victimized in those situations get help , and healing , and hope in Jesus Christ .
The game , which was an outright sensation in the early 2000s , appealed to both hardcore gamers and folks who casually played video games .
In a physical sense , their core anatomy has dramatically changed , as they ’ re stripped of their primary sexual identification and basic bodily functions .
Emotionally , they ’ ve also been stripped , as Daly has broken the crew through various heinous methods of domination in order to get them to take his command .
It is a goal for us to strive towards for the betterment of the universe , for the betterment of life itself. ” We see the ramifications of that belief system , and those who live under this system rightly call Daly an “ asshole god. ” Humanity is bound to suffer if the prevailing worldview centers on the best of humanity , because even our best ultimately leads to destruction .
On board the USS Callister , the passage in Isaiah 64:6 is illustrated before us : For all of us have become like one who is unclean , And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment ; And all of us wither like a leaf , Only by following a perfect , omniscient , and loving God – not a human “ asshole god ” – can humanity truly begin to comprehend and eventually witness the betterment of life itself .
Regardless of our skin color , our sex , or our personal backgrounds , we all have the capacity to become Daly .
Whether we ’ re bullying someone on the playground , spreading gossip and slander around the workplace , verbally abusing anonymous people in online competitions , or giggling as we construct death and destruction for hapless simulated people in The Sims , there ’ s just something about domination that calls to us .
When we depart from them , the last thing we see the crew dealing with is another gamer who seeks domination .
Almost 30 % of the time , he said , the station that is closest to the caller is not the one that responds because its equipment already is tied up .
Rape and Power in Eighteenth Century London , England Nicolari , Deanna In London , England , rape was a prevalent crime throughout society in the mid-eighteenth century .
During this time , rape was defined as `` ... unlawful and carnal knowledge of a woman , by force , and against her will , '' ( Olsson , 2013 ) .
Men were able to commit rape by exerting their power over the women and young girls , whether by using physical strength , weapons , threats , or with the help of the severely lacking criminal justice system .
His vulgar , sexual , uncouth plays were extremely popular , viewed by citizens of all statuses .
Both sexual harassment and sexual assault violence by men against women can happen in any setting , especially that of a workplace .
Assault in the workplace will go unreported for several reasons , like fear of the humiliating institutional procedures that follow a sexual assault report , the harassment endured following the attack and the possibility of getting fired from their workplace ( Alexander , 1994 .
In this review , it is evident that a hierarchy in the workplace is a major precursor to a sexual assault incident .
It is also clear , despite limitations in the reviews , that there is a positive correlation between sexual assault and depressive symptoms .
Sex Work in the 21st Century Mitzelman , Tracy ; Fulkerson , Gregory ( 2018 ) In the twenty first century , pornography and its impact on society have become evident ; specifically , there is a changing shift in moral judgments surrounding pornography .
Knox explained that she turned to pornography in order to pay college tuition because loans would not cover the expenses .
Knox backing her unconventional career choices has shifted society ’ s view on sex work , pulling it out of the bedroom and into the mainstream media .
Society is more accepting of the sex industry as a profession than it has been in the past .
These new instances of women demanding equal rights and opportunities led to shifts in cultural norms and expectations , including society ’ s perceptions of femininity and sexuality .
The flapper movement granted women of all status that may have been denied representation and rights elsewhere the freedom in expressing their sexuality , femininity , and presentation of their bodies how they pleased despite the pressures and expectations being exerted upon them by a patriarchal society .
While the flapper was a result of the expanding consumer culture in America , this does not go to cheapen what the flapper stood for in the eyes of so many women : sexual liberation , ownership of one ’ s body and sex , and the right to express the feminine self in ways unimaginable .

This Traveling Seminar Promotes Black Sexual Liberation Across The Country Sharelle Burt • Nov 28 , 2018 It ’ s almost taboo to talk about sex in the African-American community , especially for women .

When Dalychia Saah , 27 , and Rafaella Fiallo , 30 , met in graduate school , they both knew they were interested in sexuality but didn ’ t get a chance to fully explore it until after graduation .

“ But we have really received so much love and affirmation and I think it ’ s because people were so hungry for this conversation. ” Photo courtesy of Afrosexology Afrosexology offers a variety of workshops ranging from twerking to mastering the art of “ self-love. ” No one is discriminated against , as there are workshops geared toward any sexual orientation or identity .

Winning kind of put me in a spot where I was like , “ Oh shit , I guess I ’ m on top. ” That world title seemed like a jumping off point to call attention to the issues you have with the WSL ?
The novel explores sexual violence — a particularly common problem on reservations — and the way it arises , the way it affects families and communities , and the way the world often fails the women who experience it , Native women especially .
Everyone knows that some of the best books out there right now are actually young adult novels , so if you 're looking for a novel that deals with serious issues affecting young people , look no further than Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson , a story about a teenage girl who was sexually assaulted and who feels like there is n't anyone she can reach out to for help .
The book deals with a lot of heavy issues — poverty , sexual abuse , domestic violence , and institutionalized racism , to name a few — and its story is sure to stay with readers long after the final page , along with Walker 's strong voice , and her messages about black womanhood .
In it she describes everything from growing up poor in the rural South to sexual abuse to a teen pregnancy and yet the novel is ultimately , somehow , uplifting and moving .
“ If the woman you loved with all your heart left you for the Pilates instructor and just sent you an invitation to the wedding , would you go ? ” He continues , “ There ’ s a deep commitment and emotional investment that happens when you create something that is very near and dear to you , and when that is torn asunder by sociopaths who don ’ t give a shit about your feelings or the feelings of your cast and crew because they have their own reasons to screw everybody , that doesn ’ t feel good. ” Darabont must be comforted by having his own new series coming out , Mob City , starring Walking Dead alum/dead cast member , Jon Bernthal .

-- -Thom Geier , Entertainment Weekly '' Akhtar digs deep to confront uncomfortable truths about the ways we look at race , culture , class , religion , and sex in this bracingly adult , unflinching drama ... [ He ] writes incisive , often quite funny dialogue and creates vivid characters , managing to cover a lot of ground in a mere four scenes and 80 minutes .
Many previous studies have identified age , sex , and smoking status as determinants of oxidative stress [ 11–19 ] , with higher levels of 8-OHdG and F2-isoprostanes in smokers as one of the most consistent findings .
Associations with age and sex are more heterogeneous ; F2-isoprostanes and 8-OHdG have been reported to be both higher [ 17 , 20 ] and lower [ 14 , 19 ] in females .
Sociodemographics These included sex ( male/female ) , age ( years ) , ethnicity ( North European Ancestry , yes/no ) , and number of years of education .
Age , sex , level of education , plasma cotinine levels , alcohol consumption , supplement use , fasting prior to sample collection , and the season of sample collection were identified as determinants of either 8-OHdG or F2-isoprostanes , or both .
Female sex has previously been associated with lower 8-OHdG levels [ 11 , 18 ] as was also found in the present study .
The direction of the association between F2-isoprostanes and sex , however , is not consistent ; another large-scale population sample demonstrated slightly lower levels of urinary F2-isoprostanes in women than men [ 19 ] .
It has been hypothesized that differences in body composition between male and females and the influences of sex hormones in ( premenopausal ) females underlie the sex differences in oxidative stress levels .
Although it is clear that sex is an important determinant of oxidative stress , the reasons for the differences between males and females , and the inconsistencies in the direction of the findings across studies , remain to be explored .

What It ’ s Like to Attend a Furry Convention Discover the secret world of people who dress up in animal costumes—and whether they really have sex in them by Debra W. Soh Published : Apr 8 , 2015 Furry culture has fascinated me since I first encountered it several years ago .
How could you not be intrigued by the idea of people putting on animal costumes to have sex ?
A perusal of Google supports the idea that furries—people who are interested in human-like animals or creatures , and sometimes dress up in costumes accordingly—are somehow psychologically messed up or sexually deviant .
Being a furry has more to do with community than it does with sex .
One furry told me he puts his fursuit on because it ’ s a part of his identity , and sex is just something he does while wearing it .
As fun as sex is , would you risk it in a $ 2,000 custom suit ?

Depends on what you mean by “ easy. ” To begin with , there is a very conservative culture that shames and silences women about sex and opts for abstinence-only sex education , which contributes to abortion being inaccessible .
The enthusiastic incest of Siegmund and Sieglinde , for instance , calls to mind all the weird sexual stuff we 've seen in Piers Anthony , John Norman , Terry Goodkind , and any number of other fantasists .
The business with Mime outlined above , along with the preoccupation with the racial purity of the Wälsungs ( leading to the incest of Siegmund and Sieglinde ) and the constant background assumption that Jewishness is revolting and obviously depraved , must surely have endeared the Ring cycle to someone like Hitler .

I point out in the post that the author completely missed the sex abuse scandal , in which real Communists were very interested indeed in the Soviet bloc at the time she was writing , though this was not then publicly known ; she also misses Liberation Theology , which was in advanced stages of preparation at that time .
Unfortunately the leadership of Catholic schools appears to be following the example of its secular counterpart , both by imposing explicit sex education on our children and by an increasing reluctance to expect staff to live in accord with Church teaching .
The secular model is to promote anarchic sexual liberalism in schools , balanced by an hysterical concern for the procedures of child protection .
This is not going to solve the problem of the sexual exploitation of children in the long term .
According to AI “ With the prevention of violence against women as its major campaigning focus , Amnesty International ’ s leaders committed themselves anew to work for universal respect for sexual and reproductive rights. ” Their decision has alienated the catholic church , leading to the removal of support for AI and leading one school to replace AI with newly formed Benenson Society named after the catholic lawyer who founded Amnesty .

The Apicomplexa have alternating cycles of sexual and asexual reproduction .
After the completion of one or more of these asexual cycles , some merozoites differentiate into male and female gametocytes , initiating the sexual phase of the life cycle .
Intracellular protozoa with alternating sexual and asexual cycles The apicomplexan cell .
—Laderman , 1975 Plasmodium is a parasite species with a sexual cycle in mosquitoes and an asexual cycle in humans .
The plasmodia are Apicomplexa in which the sexual and asexual cycles of reproduction are completed in different host species .
The sexual phase occurs within the gut of mosquitoes and results in the formation of a motile zygote , the ookinete .
Other merozoites are transformed into sexual forms or gametocytes .
It differs from Plasmodium in that both sexual and asexual reproductive cycles occur within the gastrointestinal tract of felines , the definitive host .
Asexual and sexual cycles in felines ✺ Spread to humans from felines via fecal–oral route and via ingestion of meat Toxoplasma gondii was first demonstrated in 1908 in the gondi , an African rodent , by Nicolle and Manceaux .
The merozoites infect adjacent epithelial cells ; they then repeat another asexual cycle or eventually differentiate into gametocytes , initiating sexual reproduction .
Like many other apicomplexan parasites , they are obligate intracellular organisms that exhibit alternating cycles of sexual and asexual reproduction within the gastrointestinal tract of the same host .
These merozoites are destined to invade intestinal cells and give rise to male ( microgametocyte ) and female ( macrogametocyte ) sexual forms .
https : //www.cdc.gov/dpdx/microsporidiosis/ The easiest way to diagnose these infections is from stained clinical smears , especially of fecal samples .

The differential diagnosis of lower gastrointestinal bleeding includes a rapid upper gastrointestinal bleed , diverticulosis , infections ( e.g. , Salmonella , Shigella ) , cancer , inflammatory bowel disease , and anal fissures or hemorrhoids .

The G-spot is an erogenous zone inside our body… …that gives sexual pleasure when stimulated , and triggers an intense orgasm .
In females… …the G-spot is inside the vagina on the top side ( the upper wall of the vagina ) about 1-2 inches or two knuckles past the vaginal opening .
In males… …it ’ s located inside the rectum – on the wall of the rectum behind the penis – about two inches past the anal opening .
According to sexual health experts , the prostate is the male G-spot .
…this is because it gives sexual pleasure when it is touched or stimulated and triggers an intense orgasm .
When one is aroused , the erectile tissues in the G-spot swell with blood and it triggers pleasurable feelings when stimulated… and results in a more intense orgasm .
…the G-Spot not only triggers pleasurable feelings and a more intense orgasm when stimulated the right way , but it is also responsible for making them ejaculate and squirt .

What is sex ?
Yet they each might wonder the same things : What does love , sex , and marriage have to do with each other , and why does it matter ?
Marriage , love , and sex are tricky things .
In an age where casual sex is common and broken marriages or families are every one in two , it can be hard for a person to know how to navigate a life with love .
Not only were these two made for each other because they were of the same flesh – or kind , which is mankind – they were united in body through , you guessed it , sex .
This is because marriage and sex are two things that should never be separated .
Marriage and sex are closely intertwined .
People should only have sex if they are married and only engage in it with the person to whom they are married .
There are no third parties in this : no adultery , no threesome , no porn , etc .
Thus , sex should only be between a husband and a wife .
Sometimes the wrongness took the form of secret partners , prostitution , or rape .
People decided that so long as they loved each other , or consented to the act , they could have sex .
Because sex was disassociated with marriage , people were harmed by their own or someone else ’ s actions .
Well , love , marriage , and sex do not always follow .
For this reason , they think they are justified to have sex with the person whom they love .
They associate sex with love and love with sex instead of sex with marriage which typically results in love .
You see , when people disassociated marriage from sex , they forget its true purpose .
Then sex may and should follow .
And in fact , even when love and sex aren ’ t there , marriage still stands .
On the other hand , one can avoid the consequences of extramarital sex when one follows what the Lord has taught .
There is a right and a wrong choice regarding marriage , sex , and love .
This brings into reality a number of concerns , such as physical , emotional and sexual mistreatment .

Two of 12 top caste-based sexual violence cases from 'model ' Gujarat : NGO report The National Council of Women Leaders ( NCWL ) , a civil rights group , has compiled what it has called “ landmark cases of caste-based sexual violence ” between 1985 and 2020 to mark the first anniversary of the notorious Hathras gangrape case , which led to the death of a young Dalit woman in September 2020 .
Compiling 12 cases from 10 States , the 15-page report , released by NCWL says , the effort is to highlight how there has been “ invisibilisation of caste across these cases by the public , government , and courts , despite the clear caste-based nature of these atrocities. ” Insisting that rape is being used as a weapon by dominant caste groups to silence Dalit women and girls seeking to “ retaliate ” and “ assert ” for their rights in the “ prevailing caste , class , and social hierarchy ” , the report wonders , “ If justice was unachievable even in cases which drew national public , media , and political attention and widespread protests , what does this mean for the Dalit women and girls who are raped every day across the country and who receive minimal attention or support ? ” The first case compiled in the is of July 17 , 1985 , when a large group of Kammas ( a dominant caste ) armed with deadly weapons attacked an unarmed Dalit colony in Karamchedu in Andhra Pradesh , killing six Madiga ( Dalit sub-caste ) men and raped at least three women .
Well-known across the country , the report says , it mobilised Indian feminists to file a Public Interest Litigation which led to the formulation of Vishakha Guidelines against sexual harassment at the workplace .
A Jaipur court acquitted the accused , implying that she was lying about the rape and remarking that “ an upper-caste man could not have defiled himself by raping a lower-caste woman ” .
“ Despite threats , she spreads awareness among women and was part of a 2-month-long march of rape survivors in 2019 , to change people ’ s attitudes from shaming victims to supporting them ” , the report says .
It was recently moved from the Junagadh court to Keshod court , where it has been pending for the last three years. ” Bhanwari Devi case led to Vishakha Guidelines against sexual harassment at workplace .
It excludes unorganised sector , where Dalit women work The second case is of February 2008 , when a 17-year-old Dalit girl registered a case of gang rape by six teachers of the Primary Teacher ’ s Certificate college in Patan .
The last one compiled in the report is the Hathras gang rape and murder of Uttar Pradesh , which rocked the country last year .
“ It has been a year since the Hathras gang rape case when a 19-year-old Dalit girl was raped by four uppercaste men on a farm near her home in Bulgarhi village .
That being said , r/crossdreaming is a subforum that attracts people who are interested in the concept of crossdreaming , and the history of that forum tells me that most of the respondents are most likely people who are experiencing crossdreaming fantasies themselves , including – most likely – erotic ones .
I know that some would like to dismiss this as a result of erotic fantasies only , but cross-gender erotic fantasies might also be a sign of gender dysphoria or some kind of underlying transgender identity .

Methods : We applied an extension of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition approach to data from Demographic and Health Surveys and AIDS Indicator Surveys to quantify the differences in HIV/AIDS prevalence between women and men attributable to socio-demographic factors , sexual behaviours , and awareness of HIV/AIDS .
The decomposition analysis showed that 84 % ( P < 0.001 ) and 92 % ( P < 0.001 ) of the higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS among women in Uganda and Ghana , respectively , was explained by the different distributions of HIV/AIDS risk factors , particularly age at first sex between women and men .
Building on her work from Volumes I and II , Allen draws on four `` communities of discourse '' —Academic , Humanist , Religious , and Satirical—as she traces several recurring strands of sex and gender identity from the Renaissance to the present .

Destined to be a classic in philosophical anthropology , sexual ethics , and gender studies , The Concept of Woman III is essential reading for those who wish to make their way through the crazed maze of gender politics today with the help of a solid philosophical articulation of the differences and complementarity of the sexes .

If we 're protecting or providing people special rights because of their sexual orientation , then how far do you go with that ?
What about bestiality ?
I mean , those are all sexual preferences , so how far do we go with it ?
In their ignorance and bondage the worldly desire they often act like crazy people , Buddha out of compassion for them acts like a crazy man , too .
People may condemn the deception of this father-physician , but Buddha is like that father : he , too , employs the fiction of life and death to persuade people , who are immersed in the bondage of desire , to take this the only means to break the bondage .
Thus the world of life and death is created by mind , is in bondage to mind , is ruled by mind ; and the mind is master of every situation .
There are differneces of sex , but as for that there is no essential difference of nature , for women , with proper training , may attain enlightenment precisely as men .
Often people disregard the affinity of their true minds for Buddha 's enlightening wisdom , and because of it are caught by the entaglement of worldly passions , and become attached to discriminations of good and evil , and then lament because of their bondage and suffering .
Lust insinuates its tentacle into human emotion and sucks away the good sense of the mind until the mind withers .
It pleased him as though , being thirsty , he had found a spring of cool water , or as though , being in bondage , he had suddenly been set free .
Faith removes greed , fear and pride ; faith teaches courtesy and wins respect , faith frees one from the bondage of circumstances , faith gives one courage to meet hardship , faith gives one power to overcome temptation , faith enables one to keep his deeds bright and pure , faith enriches the mind with wisdom .
Sorrow , fear and bondage follow one 's likes and dislikes .
He who is in bondage to his likes and dislikes can not rightly understand the significance of circumstances and tends to be overcome by them ; he who is free from attachments rightly understands circumstances and to him all things become new and significant .
There is no distiction of sex on the path to enlightenment .
Fourth , they should recognize differences of sex and seniority and family rank , thus maintaining the purity of families and society .

Sex and Politics on Campus Campus censoriousness varies by party , sexual orientation , and gender identity .
Source : Quil/Shutterstock According to Gallup , 87 percent of American adults say they are “ heterosexual or straight , ” and 6 percent identify as “ LGBT. ” But sexual orientation among college students is more diverse .
An even smaller proportion of college women say their sexual orientation is heterosexual ( 69 percent ) .
This could be a result of small liberal arts schools historically having a deep relationship with and being open to promoting sexual identities .
FIRE survey data also reveal a relationship between sexuality and the willingness to censor .
While acceptance of diversity , including diversity of sexual orientation and gender identity , is laudable and overdue , data regarding the campus speech climate are concerning .
Regardless of how the numbers break down by political affiliation , sexual orientation , or gender identity , when two-thirds of college students overall ( 66 percent ) find it acceptable to shout a speaker down to prevent people from hearing a disfavored view , the difference between offense and injury has been lost .

While you are still young , it is ideal that you regularly go for check up of sexually transmitted diseases .
Most conditions that are sexually transmitted are usually asymptomatic such as azoopermia that will only be detected after unsuccessful attempts to get a child .
Thus you should check : Testosterone levels , which is the main male hormone that affects physique , behaviour , sexual activity and protein-fat metabolism .
Check u for men under the age of 40 should be done on a regular basis because the risks of heart , liver and rectum diseases are increased .
However , when that reason became more and more bullshit I started to fall off the bandwagon .

She rightly refrains from speculating too much about young Hansberry ’ s intimate life , but it ’ s hardly a leap to see how her time there—learning from indigenous and queer artists in what was , essentially , a bohemian oasis—must have nurtured her eventual embrace of her own artistic and sexual autonomy .
She certainly advocated for gender and sexual equality , and Baldwin , who was open about his own sexuality , was a close friend .
These two lists , Perry writes , illuminate the splendor and pain Hansberry— “ the passionate and opinionated intellect and the aesthete ” —felt when it came to her sexuality , to the emotional wrestling she kept mostly hidden away : “ It is a testament to the delicate strength of her pen that even this exercise in simple accounting became poetry. ” Perry ’ s concluding pages retrace “ the places Lorraine stood. ” In a diaristic manner , she recounts her travels in 2017 to Greenwich Village and Harlem ( among other places ) , searching for signs of Hansberry .
Although her love of women would be treated more kindly today , there is a good chance Lorraine ’ s sexuality would be used to push her away from the center of American theater and thought. ” Even today , Perry reminds us , one form of oppression all too often crosshatches with , and props up , a litany of others .
Because you see in the book of Exodus God is taking His whole nation out of bondage that it had been in for 400 years under Pharaoh .

While performing maintenance , the IT department discovers child pornography on the device .
In addition to these reporting requirements , at least one employer has been found liable in a civil lawsuit for failing to report child pornography found on a work computer .
In the New Jersey case of Doe v. XYC Corp. , an employee was , among other things , visiting child pornography sites while at work and sending photos of his 10-year-old step-daughter to one of those websites .
The mother of the 10-year old then sued XYC , alleging that the company knew , based on logs generated by the computer and complaints from other workers , that the employee was accessing child pornography at work .
In reversing summary judgment in XYC ’ s favor , the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court held that “ an employer who is on notice that one of its employees is using a workplace computer to access pornography , possibly child pornography , has a duty to investigate the employee ’ s activities and take prompt and effective action to stop the unauthorized activity , lest it result in harm to innocent third parties .
No privacy interest of the employee stands in the way of this duty on the part of the employer. ” Given the gravity of the conduct involved , few employers will hesitate to report an employee found to be in possession of child pornography on employer-owed computing equipment .

In Freud ’ s own privileged example of the logic of fetishist disavowal , he almost directly mirrors the aforementioned movement from the patient ’ s “ negation ” to the “ intellectual acceptance ” of the repressed , but from a different angle : a boy knows very well that his mother does not have a penis , but nonetheless , he goes on believing that she does ( Freud , 1927 , p. 147-157 ) .
Crucially , though , one can imagine a formula of Verleugnung that inverts the location of the negation , as if inverting Freud ’ s schema in the “ Verneinung ” essay itself following an “ intellectual acceptance ” of repression : “ I know very well that it is the case ( that I am that ; that the woman in my dream is my mother ; that my mother has a penis ; etc .
In light of the matrix by which we would appear to move from a positive term representing an “ intellectual acceptance of the repressed ” to a negative term constituting another Verneinung ( and thus another Aufhebung or “ lifting ” of repression in this very moment of negation ) , it would also appear that the matrix of Verleugnung that consists in a passage from negativity ( not-X ) to positivity ( X ) might be grasped in the manner of Žižek ’ s ( 1989 ) joke about the man who was cured of the belief that he was a piece of grain followed by a giant chicken ( p. 33 ) : the “ I know my mother doesn ’ t have a penis , but all the same , I believe she has one ” of Verleugnung might suitably be re-configured as “ I know she doesn ’ t have one , but does the Other know ( /do you know ? )
The formula ‘ There is no sexual relationship ’ tells us that it is real that there are two sexes , and that the real is thus “ dual. ” But [ … ] the two natural sexes are always apprehended by our species retroactively and , what is more , in an asymmetrical way ( i.e. , woman ’ s sex can only be represented phallically as not-all ) , the two of sexual difference is actually equivalent to the “ not-two , ” [ my emphasis ] the missing of the second sex .
Following Martin Luther ’ s own translation of the Bible into German , we find that Jesus tells Peter he will verleugnen him — traditionally translated as “ deny , ” and sometimes “ disown , ” but in our Freudian lexicon here , “ disavow ” — “ three times before the cock crows. ” [ 26 ] In response and in strict homology with our earlier reflection on the history of Freud ’ s “ Negation ” essay , Peter denies that he will disavow Jesus .
Of course , Peter does precisely this three times , and upon the third disavowal of knowing Jesus , the cock crows , and Peter immediately weeps upon the realization of the prophecy ( New International Version , 2011 , Matthew 26:75 ) .

While Jack never talked to me about the sexual relationship we were forging , he did talk to his LushStories Mistress at great length about it .
Nor did he suspect I had discovered his Lush Stories persona , Submale287 , and had become his “ Mistress Leta. ” I was becoming obsessed with thoughts about dominating my big brother sexually after 18 years of being his normal , socially acceptable , little sister .
Now all day long , all I could think about were all the sexy things I wanted to do to him .
While I waited for Jack to log on to Lush , I developed plans to further sexually dominate my big brother .
“ I could feel her nudity against my skin mistress , ” Jack answered .
“ But you did see her nude when I had you sneak into her bedroom while she was asleep , ” I asked .
That night I saw she shaves her pussy , but couldn ’ t see much more in the light I had , Mistress. ” “ Small tits , ” I criticized , “ don ’ t you wish they were bigger , you little worm ? ” “ Mistress , I think they are perfect .
“ Is your little cock hard now worm , ” I wondered , “ as you tell me about your sister ? ” “ Yes Mistress , ” Jack answered .
“ You are not to şişli escort bayan touch it , ” I ordered , “ Is that clear ? ” “ Yes Mistress , ” Jack typed , but I could almost detect a little whimper in his message .
“ I have new orders for you worm , ” I directed , “ you are to buy a leather cock sling for yourself and a three piece leather sleeved bikini for your sister. ” “ But Mistress , ” Jack responded , “ I don ’ t know where I could get these. ” “ Be a man , you little worm , their are sex shops everywhere and places on line , ” I told him and added , “ Maybe I should end our relationship you worm. ” “ No , please , I will get them somehow Mistress , ” Jack pleaded .
Therefore , I decided I would visit , for the first time in my life , a sex shop .
I don ’ t know what I expected would happen inside but by the way my pussy was feeling , I was ready for anything .
“ Hello my dear , may I help you ? ” she asked , sensing mecidiyeköy escort bayan my embarrassment , she added , “ First time visiting our little pleasure palace ? ” “ Yes , it is. ” I softly mumbled still looking around and seeing things I had never seen before .
I was completely at ease with her and asked , “ What would you recommend ? ” She stared at me for a few moments , and said , “ You promise not to be shocked Leta ? ” “ I can ’ t promise that , there are escort şişli things in here I can ’ t even begin to imagine , but I promise you I won ’ t be offended. ” I told her , “ What is it ? ” “ Follow me , ” she said with that twinkle again in her eye , “ This is the most wonderful thing , Leta .
“ A rubber penis ? ” I asked , disappointed and amused .
“ Deloris , I know what a dildo is… ” “ Oh , this is more than that , ” she interrupted , “ look more carefully. ” She held it up for me to examine .
“ This is a silicon ball gag with a dildo for him .
He won ’ t be able to say a single word. ” I started to laugh as I imagined this large silicon penis growing out of my brother ’ s mouth .
I fondled the flogger ’ s handle like it was a cock , stroking it ’ s soft leather handle .

I unbuttoned my shirt and moved the handle across my exposed nipples exciting them even more .
I moved the handle back down to my jeans and pushed the handle firmly against my denim covered pussy .

Jasen competes in bareback at the NSPRA rodeo .
His dream came true this year when he became the bareback world champion in two separate rodeo associations .
He rode his first horses in Tooele and fell in love with the bareback event .
To compete in bareback , a rider sits closer to the horse ’ s neck than they would during a normal ride .
After they get out of the chute , the rider has to hold on to a strap on the horse ’ s withers for eight seconds while the horse bucks .
You always try to do better than your horse. ” Riding bareback isn ’ t for the faint of heart .
In general , bareback riders suffer more injuries and walk away with more long-term damage than all other rodeo cowboys , according to the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association .
Olsen ’ s passion led him to become a state bareback champion for Bingham High School .
I don ’ t know how they got to be bull riders because I ’ m a bareback rider , but they are .
Their screaming at me is so awesome. ” Olsen didn ’ t even realize he was leading the bareback event for the Professional Senior Rodeo Association until one of his sons sent him a text about it .
“ It ’ s kind of my thing. ” Part of Olsen ’ s drive to win the PSRA bareback championship came from his desire to show gratitude for all of the family members who cheered him on .
It ’ s pretty awesome. ” In addition to winning the PSRA bareback championship , Olsen had his sights set on winning the bareback event in the National Senior Professional Rodeo Association finals Nov. 4-9 in Oklahoma .
“ I want to prove beyond any doubt that I am the bareback world champion of 2019 , ” he said .
Olsen ’ s hard work paid off when he won all three bareback rounds in the NSPRA rodeo .

Scott Fitzgerald 's penis in A Moveable Feast , but maybe it 's a good way to introduce a younger generation to Big Papa 's work .
Anyway , Zelda had told Scott his penis was too small .
I love how throughout AMF Hemingway gives exact locations of the bars and cafes he frequents ; I love how Scott has n't drunk any whiskey to prepare himself for this manly lunch among manly men ; I love how H. inspects Scott 's , er , `` junk '' in the bathroom ; and I really really love that they go to the Louvre to compare Scott 's penis with the penises of sculptures and paintings .
Maybe what happened is that Scott said something about his sexual life with Zelda ( whom H. despised anyway ) , and H. created this story out of that and his own imagination and agenda .

Mandy Marzullo : Amanda Lewis from the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault described a disrespectful victim-leaning culture at Austin PD surrounding rape cases .
I have been working with the city on sexual assault system accountability issues since 2015 , 2016 with SJP along with other community partners , and when we first got started we were looking at a tremendous mismanagement of sexual assault kits or rape kits , so a large backlog , about 4,000 kits , DNA lab was closed , all these issues not only significant for survivors hoping for accountability and justice , but also just for the larger community that depends on that evidence and depends on it being done right .
And he consistently wants to push that blame around , and that 's not a leader that can be honest and open about the changes that need to be made in his department , whether it 's the sex crimes unit or other units .
So we have been fighting for accountability and transparency within APD , we have pushed for an evaluation of the sex crimes unit so we can understand the issues that are coming up for survivors as they move through that system , and at every turn we 've gotten pushed back from the chief of police and we 've gotten pushback from Rey Arellano who has made it his goal to make sure that there 's an appearance of community participation but not actual participation .

Female Sexual Desire Dysfunction ; Symptoms , Treatment Female Sexual Desire Dysfunction ( or sexual malfunction or sexual disorder ) is difficulty experienced by an individual or a couple during any stage of normal sexual activity , including physical pleasure , desire , preference , arousal or orgasm .
According to the DSM-5 , sexual dysfunction requires a person to feel extreme distress and interpersonal strain for a minimum of 6 months ( excluding substance or medication-induced sexual dysfunction ) .
Sexual dysfunctions can have a profound impact on an individual ’ s perceived quality of sexual life .
The term sexual disorder may not only refer to physical sexual dysfunction , but to paraphilias as well ; this is sometimes termed disorder of sexual preference .
Male sexual dysfunction , especially erectile dysfunction , has been extensively studied and effective therapies are available for men with this disorder .
However , female sexual dysfunction ( FSD ) is more complicated and significantly less is understood in comparison to male sexual dysfunction .
Types of Female Sexual Desire Dysfunction The spectrum of sexual dysfunction encompasses : Decreased sexual desire—persistent or recurrent deficiency or absence of desire for sexual activity giving rise to marked distress and interpersonal difficulty ; Sexual aversion disorder—persistent or recurrent aversion and avoidance of all genital sexual contact leading to marked distress and interpersonal difficulty ; Difficulty in erection—recurrent or persistent , partial or complete failure to attain or maintain an erection until the completion of the sex act ; Difficulty in achieving orgasm—persistent or recurrent delay in or absence of orgasm , following a normal sexual excitement phase ; Premature ejaculation—persistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation , before , on or shortly after penetration and before the person wishes it , which causes marked distress .
[ rx ] Sexual dysfunction generally is classified into four categories Desire disorders —lack of sexual desire or interest in sex Arousal disorders —inability to become physically aroused or excited during sexual activity Orgasm disorders —delay or absence of orgasm ( climax ) Pain disorders — pain during intercourse List of disorders of Female Sexual Desire Dysfunction The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders lists the following sexual dysfunctions : Hypoactive sexual desire disorder ( see also asexuality , which is not classified as a disorder ) Sexual aversion disorder ( avoidance of or lack of desire for sexual intercourse ) Female sexual arousal disorder ( failure of normal lubricating arousal response ) Additional DSM sexual disorders that are not sexual dysfunctions include : PTSD due to genital mutilation or childhood sexual abuse Other sexual problems of Female Sexual Desire Dysfunction Sexual dissatisfaction ( non-specific ) Delay or absence of ejaculation , despite adequate stimulation Inability to control the timing of ejaculation Inability to relax vaginal muscles enough to allow intercourse Inadequate vaginal lubrication preceding and during intercourse Burning pain on the vulva or in the vagina with contact to those areas Unhappiness or confusion related to sexual orientation Transsexual and transgender people may have sexual problems before or after surgery .

Causes Female Sexual Desire Dysfunction Physical causes — Many physical and/or medical conditions can cause problems with sexual function .
Physical causes refer to health conditions that contribute to sexual problems or the inability to achieve satisfaction .
Some of the most common physical causes for sexual disorders include : Neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis Fatigue , frequent headaches or chronic pain Urinary or bowel difficulties Surgery , especially in the pelvic area Diseases like arthritis , diabetes or high blood pressure Use of certain medication or recreational drugs Psychological causes — These include work-related stress and anxiety , concern about sexual performance , marital or relationship problems , depression , feelings of guilt , concerns about body image , and the effects of past sexual trauma .
Clogged blood vessels ( atherosclerosis ) Metabolic syndrome — a condition involving increased blood pressure , high insulin levels , body fat around the waist and high cholesterol Peyronie ’ s disease — development of scar tissue inside the penis Alcoholism and other forms of substance abuse Treatments for prostate cancer or enlarged prostate Surgeries or injuries that affect the pelvic area or spinal cord Depression , anxiety or other mental health conditions Relationship problems due to stress , poor communication or other concerns Sexual trauma or abuse in the past Anxiety disorder and attacks Poor self-image and lack of confidence Certain medications can cause changes in the level of experienced sexual desire through “ non-specific effects on general well-being , energy level , and mood ” .
Declining levels of sexual desire have been linked to the use of anti-hypertension medication and many psychiatric medications ; such as antipsychotic medications , tricyclic anti-depressants , monoamine-oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitors , and sedative drugs .
However , the most severe decreases in sexual desire relating to psychiatric medication occur due to the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) .
Many studies associate the sex hormone , testosterone with sexual desire .
Another hormone thought to influence sexual desire is oxytocin .
Exogenous administration of moderate amounts of oxytocin has been found to stimulate females to desire and seek out sexual activity .
In women , oxytocin levels are at their highest during sexual activity .
If the gap between ejaculations extends toward a week , there will be a stronger desire for sexual activity .
There are a few medical interventions that can be done on individuals who feel sexually bored , experience performance anxiety , or are unable to orgasm .
For everyday life , a 2013 fact sheet by the Association for Reproductive Health Professionals recommends : Recalling instances when feeling sexy and sexual ( The patient is instructed to recall her physical appearance , the setting , the smells in the air , the music she was hearing , and the foods she was eating at that time and use these as ‘ cues ’ for feeling sexual now ) Social and Religious Views of Female Sexual Desire Dysfunction The views on sexual desire and how sexual desire should be expressed vary significantly between different societies and religions .
Various ideologies range from sexual repression to hedonism .
Lawson various forms of sexual activity , such as homosexual acts and sex outside marriage vary by countries .
Some cultures seek to restrict sexual acts to marriage .
In some societies , there is a double standard regarding the male and female expression of sexual desire .
Female genital mutilation is practiced in some regions of the world in an attempt to prevent women to act on their sexual desire and engage in “ illicit ” sex .
Symptoms of Female Sexual Desire Dysfunction The total absence of sexual desire or a low sex drive An inability to get aroused or maintain arousal for the duration of sexual activity Recurrent ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation Inadequate lubrication in spite of sexual excitement Not achieving an orgasm , after going through the normal excitement phase Pain while having intercourse Why It ’ s Happening – Vaginal dryness can result from hormonal changes that occur during breastfeeding or menopause .
“ A traditional or sexual therapist can help couples evolve from having the same old conversation patterns , life habits , and sexual habits to having a sexual relationship that ’ s fulfilling , invigorating , and romantic , ” says Worley .
Why It ’ s Happening – As many as 30 percents of women report pain during sex , Pain can be caused by vaginal dryness , or it may be an indication of a medical problem , like ovarian cysts or endometriosis , according to The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists .
Painful sex can also be related to vaginismus , a condition in which the vagina tightens involuntarily when penetrated .
If you experience dryness or pain during sex , it can also be harder to become turned on .
Hormonal changes due to menopause or a partner ’ s sexual issues ( like erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation ) can also make it more difficult to get in the mood .
He or she can help connect you with the right form of treatment to correct the problem , whether that ’ s seeking out sexual therapy , a medication ( like hormones ) , or treatment for your partner ’ s problem , he says .
Trouble Reaching Orgasm Why It ’ s Happening – About 5 percent of perimenopausal women experience orgasm problems , ” says Worly .
Aside from hormone changes , an inability to reach orgasm may also be due to anxiety , insufficient foreplay , certain medications , and chronic diseases .
What You Can Do – Just like other forms of sexual dysfunction , it ’ s key to talk to your doctor to address the underlying problem before trying to treat it .
suggests that being mindful during sex can make it easier to achieve orgasm .
It may also be useful to add a vibrator to your sexual repertoire , says Worley .
Diagnosis of Female Sexual Desire Dysfunction Physical exam – This might include careful examination of your penis and testicles and checking your nerves for sensation .
It involves using a wand-like device ( transducer ) held over the blood vessels that supply the penis .
This test is sometimes done in combination with an injection of medications into the penis to stimulate blood flow and produce an erection .
Treatment of Female Sexual Desire Dysfunction Most types of sexual dysfunction can be corrected by treating the underlying physical or psychological problems .
For men , drugs , including sildenafil , tadalafil , vardenafil , and avanafil may help improve sexual function by increasing blood flow to the penis .
PDE5 Inhibitors – Increasing blood delivery to the genitals with the development of the first marked PDE5 inhibitor , sildenafil revolutionized the treatment of erectile dysfunction in men .
Prostaglandins have been used in male sexual dysfunction , especially erectile dysfunction ( administered through penile injection ) , for some time and have displayed positive outcomes for certain women with genital sexual arousal disorder , most likely through increasing vaginal secretion and arterial smooth muscle relaxation [ rx ] .
Therefore , an alternative approach using an inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase ( NEP ) , the primary enzyme responsible for the degradation of VIP , has been in development under the assumption that inhibition of NEP will lead to more VIP in the circulation , which can increase clitoral and vaginal blood flow when sexually stimulated [ rx ] .
Estrogen – Estrogen plays a vital role in the regulation of female sexual function .
Estrogen plays a vital role in the regulation of female sexual function .
Centrally Mediated Stimulation – The sexual response for men and women is distinct .
This area of investigation has gained momentum by recent publication demonstrating that several hypothalamic nuclei are activated in rodent sexual response [ rx ] .

Dilators may help women who experience narrowing of the vagina .
Sex therapy — Sex therapists can be very helpful to couples experiencing a sexual problem that can not be addressed by their primary clinician .
For the couple who wants to begin enjoying their sexual relationship , it is well worth the time and effort to work with a trained professional .
Behavioral treatments — These involve various techniques , including insights into harmful behaviors in the relationship , or techniques such as self-stimulation for treatment of problems with arousal and/or orgasm .
Psychotherapy — Therapy with a trained counselor can help a person address sexual trauma from the past , feelings of anxiety , fear , or guilt , and poor body image , all of which may have an impact on current sexual function .
Education and communication — Education about sex and sexual behaviors and responses may help an individual overcome his or her anxieties about sexual function .
Open dialogue with your partner about your needs and concerns also helps to overcome many barriers to healthy sex life .
Providing education – Education about human anatomy , sexual function , and the normal changes associated with aging , as well as sexual behaviors and appropriate responses , may help a woman overcome her anxieties about sexual function and performance .
Enhancing stimulation – This may include the use of erotic materials ( videos or books ) , masturbation , and changes in sexual routines .
Providing distraction techniques – Erotic or non-erotic fantasies ; exercises with intercourse ; music , videos , or television can be used to increase relaxation and eliminate anxiety .
Encouraging non-coital behaviors – Non-coital behaviors ( a physically stimulating activity that does not include intercourse ) , such as sensual massage , can be used to promote comfort and increase communication between partners .
Minimizing pain – Using sexual positions that allow the woman to control the depth of penetration may help relieve some pain .
Vaginal lubricants can help reduce pain caused by friction , and a warm bath before intercourse can help increase relaxation .
Alprostadil self-injection – With this method , you use a fine needle to inject alprostadil ( Caverject Impulse , Edex ) into the base or side of your penis .
Alprostadil urethral suppository – Alprostadil intraurethral ( Muse ) therapy involves placing a tiny alprostadil suppository inside your penis in the penile urethra .
Side effects can include pain , minor bleeding in the urethra and formation of fibrous tissue inside your penis .
Penile implants – This treatment involves surgically placing devices into both sides of the penis .
The malleable rods keep your penis firm but bendable .
Androgen therapy The specific management involves the following stages Helping the woman develop more positive attitudes towards her genitals – After fully describing the female sexual anatomy , the therapist needs to encourage the woman to examine herself with a hand mirror on several occasions .
Extremely negative attitudes ( especially concerning the appearance of the genitals , or the desirability of examining them ) may become apparent during this stage , possibly leading to failure to carry out the homework .
Pelvic muscle exercises – These are intended to help the woman gain some control over the muscles surrounding the entrance to the vagina .
The woman can later check that she is using the correct muscles by placing her finger at the entrance to her vagina where she needs to be able to feel the muscle contractions .
Vaginal penetration – Once the woman has become comfortable with the external genital anatomy she is advised to explore the inside of her vagina with her fingers .
concerning the texture of the vagina , its cleanliness , fear of causing damage , and whether it is ‘ right ’ to do this sort of thing ) .
With this , the general programme of sex therapy is completed and now the treatment needs to include superimposition of treatment for specific sexual dysfunctions .
The sex education needs to focus on clarifying normal sexuality and reducing negative attitude for sex .

Within months , the razor-wire-bound island camps ( many operating at three times their capacity ) bore all the hallmarks of their Antipodean precedents : gross structural deficiencies , widespread physical and mental illness , corruption , violence , sexual abuse , and suicide .

I think there ’ s a lot of secondary aspects that folks don ’ t talk as much about because they ’ re not as sexy and I think entrepreneurs , you can think about which to your point reduces the activation energy and will ultimately benefit everybody .
Something that was actually annoying and difficult , because a lot of big companies can ’ t get their shit together to solve actually annoying problems , or don ’ t want to , or have internal politics that keep them from even attempting it , and dealing with a certain amount of is actually an interesting barrier to entry , particularly against really large players .

Why do we consider incest wrong , even when it occurs between consenting adults unable to have children ?
Over time these moral stances have made their way into legal codes , and disgust has thereby served as the impetus for laws against behaviors almost universally held to be “ disgusting ” ( corpse desecration , bestiality ) – and as the implicit justification for more controversial prohibitions ( homosexuality , use of pornography ) .
It would be like Jesus coming down from heaven and telling his followers that Joel Osteen is a real piece of shit and an agent of Satan himself .
Well , to his credit , Hoovie admitted that he was pretty shitty at exploiting other people ( something I suffer from as well - I took that `` do unto others '' crap too seriously ! ) .

Did the shitty post-recession economy lower everyone 's expectations to the point where driving for Uber or working for Amazon seemed like a good deal ?

Back when I thought I was a hot-shot patent lawyer and flew out to Silicon Valley every month ( when Silicon Valley made silicon and not bullshit apps ) the concept of the `` employee stock option '' was just starting to become a big deal .
Oh , shit , I just googled that , she already went there .
It seems to work , but is a bit of a pain in the ass , having to see one doctor to get a prescription ( under medicare ) and then driving an hour to the VA hospital to see another doctor to get the same prescription filled .
That is one reason why today , they are raising the age for `` full '' Social Security to 67 for people born in 1960 or later ( for some reason they always use 1960 as a benchmark for these `` fuck you '' kind of deals .

The Rape of Europa by Félix Vallatton ( 1908 ) Controversy was not far away when his nude paintings were exhibited , At the beginning of the twentieth century one exhibition of his work only allowed over 18 years of age visitors to enter and witness the naked women !
Perseus Slaying the Dragon by Félix Vallatton ( 1910 ) Another of Vallatton ’ s paintings featuring a nude but with mythological connotations was his version of the story of Perseus slaying the dragon , a story which had featured in many pasintings before .
Woman with a Black Hat by Félix Vallatton ( 1908 ) Vallatton painted hundreds of pictures featuring nude or semi-nude females and the one I like the most is his 1908 work entitled Woman with a Black Hat .

Ep # 56 : The Gift of Allowing Diamonds , when it comes to our issues with sexual intimacy , we spend so much time in resistance , denial , rejecting reality , and pushing against what is , but I want to ask you : what if we were to give up all the resistance and make allowing part of the journey – whatever the situation ?
What would relationships , sexuality , and sexual intimacy look like if you were to just allow things as they are ?
I have a size J 55 year old titties and they do hang down .
And I ’ m also celebrating my droopy titties in all their glory .
I did go and get myself some titty bangs so that I would match my daughter .
I have to allow that my titties were kind of droopy and that was okay .
I don ’ t know how many times a day that I say , “ Nothing has gone wrong here. ” I really , I need to have a t-shirt that says , “ Nothing has gone wrong here. ” Yes , I have titty bangs , something like that .
What would our relationships and our sexuality , and our sexual intimacy look like if we were just able to allow ?
So today I want to look at some common reasons that women come to me , they want to work with me on their sexual intimacy .
So , number one , in honor of my droopy titties here is the first one .
My body is not sexy enough for intimacy .
My titties are droopy .
I ’ m just not sexy enough for sex .
I can not engage in sex because I don ’ t look good enough .
It can be the body you have right now and it can be sexy as hell , 100 % sexy .
But from a place of allowing and loving our body , then we can look and see how we can approach sex and sexual intimacy .
Because if we ’ re coming from a place of loving and allowing , at the minimum allowing our body and hopefully getting to this place of loving our body , then the sexual intimacy just flows .
And if you focus on the pleasure and how this is going to positively impact your life , then you can get into this place where you are more in tune with yourself and you ’ re enjoying your libido the way it is and just recognizing it ’ s just a matter of knowing what makes me more interested in sex and what makes me less interested in sex and it ’ s okay to work at this .
Alright , number three , I ’ m not doing sex the right way .
I ’ m taking too long to have an orgasm , I don ’ t know all the new techniques , I ’ m not as good as somebody else .
And it ’ s just all these , it ’ s kind of like you ’ re outside of yourself looking down at yourself having sex and critiquing with a pad and like getting ready to score it .
We can allow sex to be the way it is .
We can allow our ‘ performance ’ , it ’ s not really a performance , but we can allow how we engage sexually with ourselves and with another person to be just the way it is .
And we recognize that nothing has gone wrong , this is just going to be part of our journey , part of our sacred journey as we go along this path to learn more about ourself , to have a better relationship with ourself sexually and then to share that with a partner if we choose .
Number four , this one is one that ’ s been coming up quite a bit , which is I can ’ t deal with or I can ’ t solve this sexual intimacy issue because it will upset my partner in some way .
Do you think the lack of sexual intimacy in the relationship isn ’ t already hurting their feelings ?
Do you want to get to this place where you can openly and honestly talk about what ’ s happening with the sexual intimacy in your relationship and together or all of you work together to improve that situation ?
Either I don ’ t have an orgasm , or I take too long , or my orgasms don ’ t look the way that other women ’ s orgasms look like .
And usually it comes from romance novels , or it comes from pornography or something like that and all that is not reality anyway .
Or the way I have an orgasm is not correct .
Their orgasms are not strong enough , they ’ re not having an orgasm , they don ’ t have it the right way .
And maybe you don ’ t have a mind blowing orgasm , but you have an orgasm for your body .
Maybe your orgasm flows throughout your whole body .
Maybe you just feel your orgasm in your big toe .
Society likes to tell you that there ’ s one way to have an orgasm , but there isn ’ t .
There ’ s thousands of ways to have an orgasm and each one of us is individual .
Can you allow and celebrate the unique way that you have an orgasm and not think that anything has gone wrong ?
Question number five , are you willing to allow your orgasm ?
Number six , I can ’ t ask for what I want in the bedroom during sex .
And there is this sense that as a woman we don ’ t have the right to prioritize our needs , or to verbalize our needs in terms of sexuality and sex .
And maybe allow the fact that some of your needs are being met sexually .
Or is sex all about duty for somebody else , taking care of your partner ’ s needs ?
You get to decide what sex is for you , what sexual intimacy is for you and if you have a right .
So , start by asking yourself , what is it that you need sexually ?
Is it that you need stimulation to your clitoris ?
Is it that you need to be held before , during and after sex ?
Number seven , sexual intercourse is not what it used to be .
My sexual intimacy has changed .
And maybe it can no longer be defined as penis and vagina sex , or penetrative sex .
You could just allow for sexual intimacy to change and the acts of sexual intimacy to change over a period of time .
I have so many women that come to me and they say their partner ’ s penis is not working so therefore there is no more sexual intercourse .
You can allow that the penis is not working .
You can allow that sexual intimacy has changed .
You can allow in any way that sexual intercourse has changed .
So , the important part of the allowing and this gift of allowing is allowing that the sexual intimacy has changed , allowing whatever factors to be there to be there .
Maybe vaginismus has developed , maybe sexual pain has developed , whatever has developed we go from this place of allowing .
And it doesn ’ t mean that we Pollyanna , be like , “ Oh , I have sexual pain now , okay. ” No , I ’ m not talking about that .
Take the time to get to this place of acceptance and allowing of what the sexual intimacy looks like at this point in time .
And I do not know who needs to hear this today but you are so much more than your dick .
Let me just tell you , you are a human being with feelings , and wants , and needs and you deserve pleasure whether or not your dick works .
So , when this dick stops working , it ’ s really when all the fun begins , but you have to decide that you ’ re going to make that choice .
And yes , I know that you may have in your mind that there is only one way to have sex and that means to stick a penis somewhere and an erect penis per se .
But you need to recognize that having an orgasm and having pleasure is separate from actually having an erection .
You can have all the sensations , and you can enjoy yourself , and you can have an orgasm .
And you can have an ejaculation whether or not you have an erect penis .
If your penis is not ‘ reliable ’ , that does mean that you close up shop .
What it does mean is that you get to know your penis .
Can you allow yourself to be more valuable than just your dick ?
Can you get vulnerable enough around this issue of your penis not working so that you can have another fabulous , fabulous 40 more years of intimacy together ?
And read his materials and recognize that you are so much more than a penis .
So , you get to allow whatever is happening with your penis and you also get to allow the fact that you deserve pleasure , and love , and intimacy , and touch at every moment in your life .
Can you allow that your penis does not work 100 % of the time the way you want it to work ?
Let met just tell you as a pansexual person , I know a penis , an erect penis is not a requirement for pleasure , and intimacy , and a fabulous sex life .
So , can you allow your penis to be just the way it is and still have a fabulous sex life ?
What matters is having fun , and having pleasure , and then enjoying yourself and exploring sexuality , sexual intimacy , sex just in general .
You probably will not have the same sex or have it the way that you did when you were in your 20s .
If we can just get to this place of not necessarily lamenting that we have a back problem or a hip problem , or we need lubrication , or our titties are hanging low .
And yeah , it ’ s going to impact sexual intimacy , but we get to choose how we have it impact .
Or maybe we have delayed ejaculation issues , or maybe we have other issues going on .
If you recall my interview with my client Didi , who was 74 at the time , she has fabulous sex all the time , much better sex than I have .
Does she have penetrative sex ?
But her sex is amazing .
The sexual intimacy that she has made for herself and created while working with me is just fabulous and you get to create that as well .
And the bonus allowing is for the fact that sex can get better , and better , and better every single year .
And you get to allow for whatever sexual intimacy issue that you are dealing with at this point in time .
And you get to allow for the fact that you get to create the sexual intimacy that you want in your future .
So , you get to allow and to choose , and to make your sex life whatever way you want to .

Best Los Angeles Employment Law Lawyers Los Angeles Employment Law relating to Sexual Harassment Los Angeles Employment lawyers protect employees from sexual harassment .
Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and California ’ s Fair Employment and Housing Act among others .
Unwelcome sexual advances , requests for sexual favors , and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual ’ s employment , unreasonably interferes with an individual ’ s work performance , or creates an intimidating , hostile , or offensive work environment .
Sex-Based Discrimination under Los Angeles Employment Laws Los Angeles Employment Attorneys , represent their clients and seek protection under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act ( FEHA ) , which protect Los Angeles Employees against employment discrimination on the basis of sex as well as race , color , national origin , and religion .
It is unlawful for Los Angeles employers to discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of his/her sex in regard to hiring , termination , promotion , compensation , job training , or any other term , condition , or privilege of employment .
Title VII and FEHA also prohibit Los Angeles employment decisions based on stereotypes and assumptions about abilities , traits , or the performance of individuals on the basis of sex .

Test animals should be characterized by reference to their species , strain , sex , and weight or age .
In order to achieve this number , it is usually necessary to start with 30 animals per sex per group in the first parental group ( F0 ) and 25 animals per sex per group ( at least one male and one female from each litter , with a maximum of two of each sex per litter ) in the parents of each consecutive generation .
The weight and sex of each live fetus should be determined .
The neonates should be carefully observed , and their sex and weight should be noted on postnatal days zero ( day of birth ) , four , seven , fourteen , and 21 .
Anogenital distance should be measured at day zero for all F2 pups that show treatment-related effects in F1 sex ratio or sexual maturation .
Only a small number of weanlings of each sex are selected for further use in the reproduction study ; the remaining animals could be sacrificed and evaluated at three weeks or allowed to mature to six or eight weeks of age .
Necropsy of Weanlings At the time of termination , at least two pups per sex per litter from unselected F1 and F2 weanlings should be examined macroscopically for any structural abnormalities or structural changes .
For parental females , the vagina , uterus with cervix , ovaries with oviducts , adrenal and pituitary glands , target organs , and grossly abnormal tissue should be preserved .
General Histopathology Full histopathological examination of the organs should be performed for ten randomly selected control and high-dose F0 and F1 animals per sex .
The following indices should be calculated for each reproduction study : female fertility , gestation , and live-born indices ; weaning index or lactation index ; sex ratio ; and viability indices at postnatal days four , seven , fourteen , and 21 .
Sex Ratio and Percentage by Sex Determining the sex of pups at birth and verifying their sex at each weighing permits the relative fitness of each sex to be calculated as the offspring mature .
The sex ratio is useful in detecting if the test substance is preferentially affecting one sex .
For the sex ratio index , a two-tailed Fisher exact test may be used .

No more bondage , no more hostility , no more temptations ; none of the evil , the sickness , and disease that Satan brings .
When you fall keep getting back up because someday you ’ re going to be free , someday the bondage will be gone , someday you ’ re going to shine ; you really are .
But when you get up don ’ t just sit on your butt and wait for that future to come to you ; ‘ Ok , I ’ m just going wait for God to take [ this problem , this difficulty ] away. ’ It doesn ’ t work like that .
But it ’ s the reality of the situation that our bodies are in this corrupted state ; we ’ re under the bondage of principalities and powers ; even nature is messed up .
That ’ s the truth that confronts the lie that says Babylon power wins ; domination , coercive power , violent power [ wins ] .

But to approach this from the beginning , Frank said it ’ s bullshit ( and nonsense ) that waldorf schools want to prevent children from reading and writing and from learning to read and write early , giving lots of more or less irrelevant arguments , among them how bad it is to pressure children .
But what Diana had written was not bullshit .
I wrote : In my own experience , and in the experience of lots of other people I ’ ve heard the same thing from , it ’ s certainly not bullshit .
The picture Frank tries to paint is strangely unfamiliar , which leads me to think that either his waldorf school ( s ) is ( are ) unique , or he doesn ’ t know what he ’ s talking about , or he ’ s making shit up .
I think this is one reason waldorfs schools don ’ t manage to fuck up children ’ s lives to a greater extent than they do .
But that there is a negative and discouraging attitude towards early reading — even woth regard children who have taught themselves to read — is certainly not bullshit , as Frank claimed .
They ’ re wasting years on this shit .
We are to renounce unnecessary possessions , actually feed the poor , confess him with our lips , reverence human sexuality through chaste living , accept suffering , even embraced it , for the sake of the kingdom , and so forth .
They ’ re not fornicating , they ’ re cohabiting , it ’ s not an act of sodomy it is “ gay ” etc .
These words lay the foundation for what is put forward today under the term “ gender ” as a new philosophy of sexuality .
According to this philosophy , sex is no longer a given element of nature , that man has to accept and personally make sense of : it is a social role that we choose for ourselves , while in the past it was chosen for us by society .

This work makes palpable the experiences that women face everyday , the double think that is necessary for our survival and the residue left after a rape .
Through the use of objects , video and sound , the feelings women experience as a result of this very violent crime take form , creating a situation where the perceiver can better understand just how violent a crime rape is and how the effects resonate in the minds of the victims .

The desire to ban speech about black inferiority might arguably be more left-of-center if we knew the people interviewed were in the Deep South , but if it was taken in , say , New York City then I think there would be general consensus from both sides that this kind of speech sucks .

This is like going to see an old surfing movie , and when the mildly erotic beach scene is about to occur there ’ s a spliced-in , 5-minute public service announcement about the clichéd and opportunistic shots of women ’ s breasts and butts ( like everybody doesn ’ t already know that ) before the film resumes in another location .
It ’ s OK to like boobs Even if Waterhouse and other Pre-Raphaelites sometimes made deliberately beautiful and prurient images of women – call it light erotica if you like – under whatever pretext , what ’ s the big deal ?
If we need to shield our eyes from these classical paintings , than other works by Klimt , Schiele , Reubens , Titian , Modigliani , Manet , and Picasso… are going to have to go , as is virtually all erotic art and certainly all porn .
In their defense , I don ’ t THINK they are necessarily saying sex is bad , or erotic art is bad , but rather that a narrative in which women are consigned to being merely pretty , sexual playthings , or else femme fatales is the problem .
We are thus left with non-prescriptive , fantastical , lightly erotic , mythological paintings of women , which Gannaway nevertheless insists are “ harmful stories ” .
Here it is hard to escape all erotic art – which necessarily focuses on some aspect of physical allure rather than mental power – being categorized as “ harmful ” and thus subject to being purged .
If Renoir painted women as if they were created by a mad scientist entirely from a cell of breast tissue , it doesn ’ t necessarily follow that he ’ s dictating that people should believe women are mindless sex marshmallows .
The fatal flaw of the stunt was to remove an extraordinarily beautiful painting which was the product of hundreds of hours of work , a lifetime of dedication , and an elaborately evolved vision , and replace it with a lecture on a piece of paper and some office supplies on the grounds that the original art was too erotic and objectionable for us to see .

They strive to learn its basics in order to understand what is the attitude of the representative of the stronger sex towards them .
What does it mean for a representative of the stronger sex to pat a lady on the back ?
With such non-verbal signals , you can only count on the friendship of the stronger sex , no more .
But when communicating , a representative of the stronger sex from time to time invades the boundaries of the personal space of his colleague or classmate , that is , he comes closer to her than at arm 's length .

Sample from New Thriller by James Musgrave I am working with a woman , Lily Orkidedatter ( Orchid Daughter ) , who works with the authorities to trap pornographers and other incest and child traffickers in Norway , to star in my upcoming thriller .
Also , more specifically , we were both abused sexually as children .
I believe it was this connection , more than any other , that created our psychological bond , and which led to her permission allowing me to work with her on an increasingly complex case that involved both rape ( my experience ) and incestuous abuse , coupled with a child ’ s outrageous response ( the murder of the adult involved ) , ( Lily ’ s experience ) .
I mean that because Lily and I have direct experiences with the reality of rape , incest , and sexual manipulation , as well as the retaliation involved , we can communicate much better than any officer of the State can who has no such experience .
This is the poem that led to our bonding and discussing her case , and , as it so happens , it became our ticket to working together on an international sex trafficking ring and subsequent sting operation that soon was in the headlines of the world media , well before it should have been .

Popular Feminism : Male Victimhood February 22 , 2019 • By Sarah Banet-Weiser This is the sixth and final installment in a column that explored some of the different cultural facets of popular feminism , the # MeToo movement , and the contemporary cultural awareness of sexual harassment in the workplace and in daily life .
These essays are not meant to be exhaustive , but rather to point up the ways the current environment is responding to gender dynamics , sex , and power .
But I also acknowledged that # MeToo has offered an important multi-media platform for many women to come forward and give an account of their experiences with sexual harassment and assault .
Almost exactly a year after The New York Times published their piece detailing the sexual harassment accusations against Harvey Weinstein , a different , though eerily similar , set of stories started competing with the # MeToo narrative in terms of visibility on the same media platforms .
We witnessed this in the hearings for the new Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh , who was accused of sexually assaulting Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers and exploded in rage in defense of his “ good name. ” Reactionary psychologist and guru Jordan Peterson has capitalized on white male victimhood , lamenting the fate of young males in his YouTube channel videos .
Let men be damn men. ” In an article in spiked titled “ The Crusade Against Masculinity , ” Frank Furedi claims that the “ MeToo-inspired advert ” is pathologizing masculinity itself : “ Since the rapid ascendancy of the # MeToo movement , the moral crusade against masculinity has gained widespread support among the cultural elites and mainstream media. ” Yet , in Furedi ’ s world , the outrage and the claims of victimhood by men called out on sexual harassment and assault do not constitute a “ moral crusade , ” but are rather a legitimate reaction .
In the post- # MeToo age , we must identify gendered violence as a structural problem , caused by centuries of sexism , racism , misogyny , and manifest in rape culture and other dangerous practices .
( 1/199 ) OBJECTIVE : Adolescents and adults with a history of sexual victimization ( SV ) are at increased risk of engaging in sexual risk behaviors .
This study seeks to examine race- and gender-based differences in SV as well as the association between SV and reproductive health outcomes ( pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections [ STIs ] ) among young adults from an urban community with high rates of both outcomes .
Further research is needed to explore the mediators of these outcomes and the value of sexual safety and child protection programs for pregnancy and STI prevention in urban environments .
Severity of emotional abuse , sexual abuse , and overall childhood trauma was associated with the number of days cocaine was used during follow-up in women , as was the association of severity of physical abuse and overall childhood trauma with the average amount of cocaine used per occasion .
( 8/199 ) Adult Sexual Risk Behavior Among Women With a History of Childhood Sexual Abuse - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov Adverse childhood events , including physical and sexual abuse , can cause significant distress for those affected , during both childhood and adulthood .
Childhood abuse appears to increase the risk of a number of negative outcomes later in life , including psychiatric disorders , substance abuse , and HIV and sexually transmitted infections .
Previous research has consistently found an association between childhood sexual abuse and greater rates of adult sexual risk behavior .

One married couple agreed to mutually leave their sexual history undisclosed .
Sleeping with her best friend and possibly fathering a child is not what was meant by their agreement not to discuss their sex lives while they were broken up. ” “ The fact that OP doesn ’ t even think that his wife has a right to be upset makes him an even bigger AH. ” – DawnaZeee “ It ’ s one thing not to talk about who they slept with if that ’ s what they agreed on. ” “ But it ’ s pretty stupid of him to be claiming he had no reason to suspect the child could be his. ” “ I feel like he should have either made an effort to find out about the paternity of the child , or he should have discussed the possibility with his wife , and they could have figured out how they wanted to proceed together. ” – TheHottestJupiter “ Indeed , what he meant to say was ‘ there was a perfectly good justification for me to not deal with it , so I didn ’ t .
I assume the wife had been with other people as well and didn ’ t want to talk about it .. she doesn ’ t get to then be pissed to find out that her husband slept with her friend and that a potential consequence of having sex happened. ” “ Especially if the friend opted not to contact him and say ‘ this child could be yours ’ he wasn ’ t obligated to reach out. ” “ Honestly this one can go either way. ” – WafflesAreEpic When someone implied the OP would be TA ( the a * * hole ) for not “ wanting to deal with the child , ” Redditor WafflesAreEpic asked readers to “ imagine ” a fictional scenario .
The way this is written sounds like willful ignorance. ” “ He didn ’ t want to deal with an uncomfortable problem so he convinced himself it wasn ’ t a significant possibility , or even a significant probability. ” “ When you have the ‘ I don ’ t want to know who you slept with ’ conversation , I personally feel that if the fallout from that period has the potential to damage the wife ’ s relationship with her best friend , and significantly impact the rest of all marriage/ lives it ’ s a sh * * ty thing to call her out on a technicality and claim she has no right to be upset that this huge secret was kept from her because they agreed not to discuss the sex part. ” “ Also honestly the best friend is also TA for sleeping with her best friend ’ s ex and keeping it a secret .

Ghislaine Maxwell deserves at least 55 years in prison Ghislaine Maxwell should get up to 55 YEARS in prison for role in trafficking underage girls for ex boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein , prosecutors say Prosecutors have asked that Ghislaine Maxwell spend at least 30 years in prison Maxwell was convicted of helping Jeffrey Epstein recruit , abuse girls for years The 60-year-old blamed her behavior on him and her deceased father Federal prosecutors asked a judge on Wednesday night to sentence her to at least 30 years in prison Maxwell will be sentenced on Tuesday and could spend much of the rest of her life in prison She was convicted in December on five of the six counts she faced , including sex trafficking , after a monthlong trial Witnesses testified she helped Epstein recruit , groom and abuse underage girls Maxwell ’ s lawyers have asked the judge to impose a sentence shorter than the 20 years that the court ’ s probation department had recommended British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell should spend at least 30 years in prison for her role in the sexual abuse of teenage girls over a 10-year period by her onetime boyfriend , financier Jeffrey Epstein , prosecutors said Wednesday in written arguments .
The 60-year-old Maxwell , Jeffrey Epstein ’ s accomplice , was convicted on five out of six charges in December , including sex trafficking of a minor – the youngest victim a 14-year-old girl , transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity , and three related counts of conspiracy , and faces a maximum 55 years in jail .
British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell should spend at least 30 years in prison for her role in the sexual abuse of teenage girls over a 10-year period by her onetime boyfriend , financier Jeffrey Epstein , prosecutors said Wednesday in written arguments This sketch shows the moment Maxwell was convicted of five of the six counts she faced in December 2021 .

‘ It is unsurprising that a woman who had led a life of incredible luxury should complain about her life as a prisoner , but that fact does not come close to meriting leniency at sentencing , much less the extraordinary degree of leniency the defendant seeks. ’ Maxwell ’ s legal team wrote a filing to the court saying that the alleged sexual abuse suffered by Ms Ransome at the hands of Epstein and Maxwell ( left ) falls outside of the time period for offences covered by the trial They also cited what they described as Maxwell ’ s ‘ complete failure to address her offense conduct and her utter lack of remorse .

Prosecutors in New York revived the case and charged Epstein with sex trafficking in 2019 , but he killed himself in jail before he could face trial .
Ghislaine Maxwell has remained mostly silent about the Epstein allegations over nearly two decades , but in a 2016 deposition in a civil case , she said she learned about the allegations against him ‘ like everybody else , like the rest of the world , when it was announced in the papers.´´ She said she never saw Epstein getting massages from anyone under 18 and that no one ever complained to her that Epstein demanded sex .

Sexual assaults , rapes and sexual misconduct or harassment by law enforcement officers acting under color of law can give rise to a civil cause of action under 42 U.S.C .
Federal district court cases in Houston and San Antonio , Texas , point out that police officer sexual misconduct can subject municipalities to civil liability for damages under 42 U.S.C .
section 1983 where , for example , there is a failure to supervise the officer and deliberate indifference to the rights of the person subjected to sexual assault by a law enforcement officer .
The problem of sexual misconduct among law enforcement is recognized by law enforcement and the International Association of Chiefs of Police .
According to the International Association of Chiefs of Police , sexual offenses and sexual misconduct by police officers represent a grave abuse of the authority that the badge represents and it is imperative that law enforcement executives prepare proactively to address and prevent police officer sexual misconduct since police officer sexual misconduct harms people and damages the bond of trust between law enforcement departments and the communities they protect and serve .
The International Association of Chiefs of Police recommends aggressive leadership action when officers tarnish the badge by committing sexual offenses .
Quoted in the organization ’ s executive guide , an author familiar with the subject of police officer sexual misconduct asserts that undocumented , uninvestigated and un-adjudicated law enforcement sexual misconduct often escalates .
Indeed , sexual misconduct within a law enforcement agency may be indicative of a need for systemic and cultural changes .
A study discussed in The Police Chief : The Professional Voice of Law Enforcement provides empirical data on an unprecedented number of cases involving police sexual misconduct and violence .
The most serious offense charged in over 20 % of the cases was forcible rape , followed by forcible fondling at 19.5 % , statutory rape at 10.8 % and , among other categories , forcible sodomy at 9.9 % .
A study by the U.S. Department of Justice found that Texas prisons and jails have some of the highest rates of inmate sexual abuse in the United States .
The Observer reported that the Harris County jail had the third highest rate of sexual abuse among the more than 350 jails surveyed nationwide .
Sexual abuse within this aspect of law enforcement can involve not only inmate-on-inmate sexual misconduct but also staff-on-inmate sexual misconduct .
Rapes , sexual misconduct and other forms of unlawful sexual harassment among law enforcement is a recognized problem and people subjected to this type of violation have rights they can assert for relief .

Dr. Pepper Bottling Co. , 130 F.3d 349 , 356 ( 8th Cir .
1997 ) ( the word nigger is among some of the most offensive racial epithets ) ; Swinton v. Potomac Corp. , 270 F.3d 794 , 817 ( 9th Cir .
2001 ) ( the word “ nigger ” is perhaps the most offensive and inflammatory racial slur in English , a word expressive of racial hatred and bigotry ) ; Tademy v. Union Pac .
2008 ) ( “ Indeed , it is difficult to imagine a message more calculated to make an African-American feel unwelcome in the workplace than ‘ nigger ’ engraved in his or her individual workplace ” ) .

Texas Labor Code Chapter 21 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbid employment-related sexual harassment .
These laws make it unlawful to harass a job applicant or employee based on the individual ’ s sex .
The illegal harassment can include sexual misconduct , unwelcome sexual advances , sexual derogatory language , requests for sexual favors , and other verbal or physical harassment that is sexual in nature .
Both men and women can be victims of sexual harassment and harassers can be co-workers , supervisors , managers , owners , clients and customers .
Sexual harassment can occur with unwelcome physical contact such as unwanted kissing , groping , fondling , or touching , as well as sexual assault and rape .
Workplace misconduct of a sexual nature is not limited to any particular industry or types of businesses .
Hostile work environments created by sexual harassment can arise in the restaurant and bar industry and the construction industry , as well as in the oilfield , in manufacturing facilities and refinery plants , among many other places of employment .
When workers report sexual harassment to employers and are retaliated against in response to their lawful complaints , retaliation is prohibited and Texas Labor Code Chapter 21 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 can provide a basis for claims against the employer .

Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh studied the effects of sexual harassment on women between 40 and 60 years of age .
In particular , women who had endured sexual harassment at work were 9 % more likely to have high blood pressure than women that hadn ’ t experienced similar issues .
The fact that sexual harassment may impact a woman ’ s blood pressure in midlife could put her at increased risk for a fatal health incident years down the road .
Women who had been sexually harassed at work suffered health problems in other ways , as well .
Mental health issues can easily lead to increased disability or an early physical decline for the victims of sexual harassment .
Ultimately , this kind of information can help the victims of sexual harassment recover their health because they now know what issues might be linked to their trauma .
It also gives new power to victims who want to pursue a sexual harassment claim .
Research like this can help a jury better understand the real consequences of sexual harassment in the workplace for victims .

When Parents Are the Greatest Barrier to Teaching Teens About Sex Copious research shows that medically accurate sexual education courses reduce the risk of STDs and unplanned pregnancies among students—but some parents and administrators still fear that just talking about sex will lead teenagers astray .
by Steph Auteri Photo by Peter Dazeley via Getty Eight years ago , while Sameera Qureshi was working as an occupational therapist at an Islamic private school in Canada , she frequently overheard students bullying each other using sexually charged language .
Schoolyard bullying is depressingly common among middle school and high school students—as is verbal sexual harassment—but the insults stood out in Qureshi 's mind for another reason .
She was surprised by the amount of inaccurate knowledge the teenagers had , and the myths they believed about the body and about intimacy : that menstruation was dirty , for example , or that using a tampon breaks the hymen , which in turn leads to the loss of virginity , or that boys ca n't control their emotions and sexual desires , while girls can .
Read more : 'She Did n't Say Vagina ' : Sex Ed in Fundamentalist Christian Homeschool When she looked into the curriculum , Qureshi realized there were no required sexual health classes .
Concerned with these gaps in knowledge and understanding , she enlisted the help of the Islamic Studies staff at the school—and a local sexual health center—in order to develop a faith-based curriculum , one that acknowledged religious and cultural values around modesty , purity , and privacy .
Qureshi 's experience is n't uncommon : According to the Guttmacher Institute , only 24 states and the District of Columbia mandate sex education , and only 13 states require it to be `` medically accurate . ''
In some states , there 's a financial incentive to provide incomplete sexual education to students—the federal government bequeaths millions of dollars in funding to abstinence-only education programs per year .
And in other cases , there is a lack of understanding about the intentions and benefits of comprehensive sexuality education .
With opponents of comprehensive sex ed believing that certain pieces of information are inappropriate , or that children should be learning about sex from their parents instead of in their schools—or even that learning about sex encourages more kids to have it , in turn leading to a greater number of teen pregnancies and STIs—it can be difficult to build a case for its need .
In late 2015 , for instance , Angela Kennedy , the chair of the Toronto Catholic District School Board , vociferously opposed a new sex ed curriculum introduced by Ontario 's government that taught students about consent , masturbation , gender expression , and the correct names for body parts , citing her Catholic beliefs : `` Catholic schools should n't be forced to teach a program that does n't ground the expression of sexuality in love and marriage , '' she said in a statement .
But she publicly changed her position a year later , after learning that her stepson had been sexually abused as a child .
Research shows that early childhood sexual education like this can protect students from sexual abuse , or at least make it more likely for them to report it , something Kennedy acknowledged .
Advocates stress that it 's crucial to speak to parents and administrators about the positive impacts of healthy sexuality—and the negative impacts when sexual health is ignored .
Research on comprehensive sexuality education programs has shown that they reduce the prevalence of risk behaviors that lead to STDs and unplanned pregnancy , and that they promote healthy relationships , which in turn reduces the risk of sexual assault and intimate partner violence .
In Qureshi 's experience , in fact , comprehensive sex education tends to have an anti-aphrodisiac effect .
In Toronto , Ontario , hundreds of parents pulled their kids from a first-grade sexual education class earlier this year because they thought the information presented—which included proper names for genitalia , rather than vague descriptors like `` private parts '' —were inappropriate .
Similarly , parents in Utah recently demanded that sexual education videos shown to fifth grade students be censored , removing references to subjects like penis length , breast size , and `` how thinking about girls or sexual things leads to erections . ''
Chris Thrasher , the senior vice president of behavioral health at Sharecare and a certified sexuality counselor and educator , emphasizes the need to work collaboratively with parents who are opposed to sex ed , rather than seeing them as simply antagonistic .
He notes that most parents with conservative beliefs about sexuality have good intentions : `` All parents want their kids to stay kids in perpetuity , '' he explains .
`` Sexuality educators can be a bridge , helping students learn information and easing parents ' fears , '' says Lindsay Cain , a doctoral candidate in human sexuality at Widener University .
`` If needed , we can reiterate that while we teach facts , values are instilled at home , reinforcing parents ' role as a sexuality educator as well . ''
`` They wonder , Will I be teaching kids how to have sex ?
He speaks of his time working for Dr. David Satcher , the former Surgeon General of the United States , when they convened a national consensus process on sexual health and responsible sexual behavior .
At the time , they put together people from different backgrounds , all across the political spectrum , with the intention of reaching consensus on what public policy was needed in the area of sexual health .
No matter how the students view sex and sexuality , it 's not the place of the educator to tell them what 's right or wrong .
`` A lot of the kids I 've worked with buy into waiting , into being abstinent before marriage , '' says Qureshi , `` yet a lot of them at the same time do things they did n't feel good about : They engage in sexting , watch pornography , have intimate relationships .
`` If we define sexual health in its broadest manner , '' she says , `` information can be incorporated in different ways .
I think it 's about maybe breaking this notion of sex education down into components that can be related to someone 's everyday functioning . ''
When Qureshi was young , her parents opted out of allowing her to attend her school 's sex ed classes. ``

Statement Regarding Marianists Who Formerly Served in The Diocese July 8 , 2020 — Since 2007 , the Catholic Diocese of Fort Worth has publicly promulgated a list of clergy with credible allegations of sexual abuse of a minor .
As the list makes clear , it contains the names of clergy who have served in the Diocese of Fort Worth since its establishment in 1969 whom the Diocese has reason to believe engaged in the sexual abuse of a minor within the Diocese of Fort Worth .
Daniel Triulzi and John Schlund , two Marianist members who at one time served in the Diocese of Fort Worth , have been named on a recently-released list of Marianist members found to have sexually abused a minor while serving in other dioceses .
Those members have never been alleged to have committed sexual abuse of a minor in the Diocese of Fort Worth or while assigned in the Diocese of Fort Worth .
Complete statement Outreach to victims of sexual abuse and their family members in the Diocese of Fort Worth is grounded in Jesus ' words : Amen , I say to you , whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine , you did for me .
To continue its outreach to every person who has been the victim of sexual abuse as a minor by anyone in church service , whether the abuse was recent or occurred many years in the past .

Why you should have sex at least once a week Couples often ask me how frequently they should be having sex , and , until recently , I 've always responded that there 's no one right answer .
After all , a couple 's sex life is affected by so many different factors : age , lifestyle , each partner 's health and natural libido and , of course , the quality of their overall relationship to name just a few .
What might seem like too much sex to one person may seem like too little to another : ( Remember that scene in Annie Hall , in which Woody Allen and Diane Keaton are discussing their sex life , split-screen , with their respective therapists ?
As my colleague and fellow contributor to Good in Bed , Dr. Gail Saltz , says : `` If your sex drives are out of balance , your aim is to meet in the middle , having sex a bit more than one partner likes but probably a bit less than the other likes . ''
So while there may be no one right answer to the question of how often couples should have sex , lately I 've somewhat been less equivocal and advising couples to try to do it at least once a week .
That 's because I believe that sex ruts are becoming epidemic .
Not long ago CNN reported that 40 million Americans are stuck in sexless marriages , and in my own practice I 've seen an increase in sex ruts and low-desire relationships due to a number of factors : The stress of the recession and the toll it 's taking on relationships Couples are too busy and too tired for sex The side effects of many medications which inhibit desire ( especially anti-depressants in the SSRI family ) The easy access to Internet porn The rise in obesity and other health/lifestyle issues that dampen libido Sex seems to be rapidly falling to the bottom of America 's to-do list but , in my experience , when couples stop having sex their relationships become vulnerable : to anger , detachment , infidelity and , ultimately , divorce .
I believe that sex matters : It 's the glue that keeps us together and , without it , couples become `` good friends '' at best or `` bickering roommates '' at worst .
Beyond the fact that sex is fun and free and enables couples to stay tuned in and turned on , what are some other reasons to do it this week ?
A healthy sex life may even make you a superstar at the office : Recent research by biological anthropologist Helen Fisher , Ph.D , .
suggests that people who enjoy regular sex may be more successful at work , possibly because sex can increase confidence and increase self-esteem .
It 's easy to forget how much fun sex can be , and just having sex once a week will put you back in a regular groove .
And if you 're stuck in a sex rut , think about the following : 1 .
Your sexual health is connected to your overall health , and it 's no surprise that people who have sex more frequently are also healthier overall .
If you 're too tired for sex , it probably means you 're too tired in other areas as well , and that you 're not taking care of yourself as much as you should be .
Not only does stress release cortisol , which inhibits testosterone , but studies have also shown that for a woman to want to have sex ( and to enjoy it ) parts of the female brain associated with outside stressors need to deactivate .
Non-sexual physical intimacy builds a foundation for sexual desire .
In the end , remember , if you want to have a satisfying sex life , you have to have the sort of relationship that supports your sex life .
Bea and Paul waste no time getting into honeymoon mode , having sex , cooking pancakes , fishing out on the lake , and generally being their darling , ridiculously in-love selves .
When making breakfast , she forgets to batter the French toast and just leaves nude bread to burn on the grill , and she forgets to grind the beans in the coffee maker .
She starts losing interest in sex , even though she was previously all about it .
From this point forward , things take a more body-horror type turn , as various fluids such as blood , slime , and weird webbing begin coming out of Bea ’ s vagina and other orifices .
Right away , the movie sucks you in , especially since nothing is really explained right off the bat , and additionally since after disposing of the body in a bonfire in broad daylight , Uncle John is seen bein ’ a neighborly and well-respected member of the small farming community , sitting with his oldster buddies at the local cafe .
Ben and Kate , clueless as to what ’ s been going on , wonder what got up his butt , but John covers for him , saying he just had to go to work .
But luckily — spoiler alert — John emerges from the barn and whacks Danny ( quietly ) upside the head with the rifle butt , then slowly and silently squeezes the life out of him , thereby saving his nephew and his nephew ’ s new love without them even knowing they were ever in danger .
So today ’ s pairing was something of a happy accident , and I will say that even though the two films are starkly different in their methods of attack , both had some surprisingly insightful things to say about friendship , trust , and mental illness , aside from both being scary as fuck .
They have the drink , Josef confesses some decidedly un-kosher things about his wife , and then Aaron decides now is the time to get the fuck out of Dodge .

Danny , knowing a great fucking deal when he sees one , agrees .
For instance , why was Joe so adamant that Danny live in the apartment , and what was with his oddly paternalistic and almost sexual interest in Danny ?

In fact , human papillomavirus ( HPV ) is believed to be the most common cause of anal cancer , with approximately 90 % of anal cancer cases being linked to an HPV infection .
Although most HPV infections will not develop into anal cancer , having had an HPV infection means you have a greater likelihood of developing the malignancy .
Other risk factors for developing anal cancer include : Having another type of cancer ( such as penile , cervical , vaginal or vulvar cancer ) Having a weakened immune system ( whether due to having HIV , taking certain medications or another reason ) Regularly experiencing anal abnormalities ( such as fistulas , soreness , swelling and redness ) Engaging in receptive anal sexual activity Notably , individuals with none of these risk factors can still develop anal cancer .
The term “ HPV ” refers to a collection of more than 150 different viruses , and the one that ’ s most likely to cause anal cancer is Type 16 .
HPV is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact with an infected body part , typically during sexual activity , and once an infection occurs , it may spread from one area of the body to another ( for example , from the genitals to the anus ) .

Exposing Sex Stereotypes in Recent Same-Sex Marriage Jurisprudence DeborahAWidissElizabethLR.pdf Widiss , Deborah Rosenblatt , Elizabeth In 1993 , the Hawaii Supreme Court held in Baehr v. Lewin that same-sex couples denied the right to marry could state a claim for sex discrimination .
But while sex discrimination has been argued by the plaintiffs in each of these cases , no state high court since Baehr has found that denying a same-sex couple the right to marry successfully states a sex discrimination claim .
Rather , the subsequent decisions have either ignored or rejected sex discrimination arguments .
Indeed-and most troubling-several of the more recent opinions rejecting same-sex couples ' claims to the right to marry have actually relied in part on sex stereotypes , even as they reject arguments that such stereotypes are embodied in and perpetuated by exclusionary marriage laws .
This Article considers the sex discrimination arguments in the context of the flurry of recent decisions issued by state courts and the arguments presented by parties and amici before those courts .

This is a difficult story to tell , and I ’ ll leave out many details , but the gist of it is , sex happened .

Many pastors are afraid to talk about sexual sin , whether they involve cohabitation or other sexual sins .
Recognizing that disparities in HIV and sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) result from a complex interplay of biological , behavioral , and structural factors that confer unequal opportunities for risk and protection , it is now widely accepted that effective HIV/STI prevention must address the synergy between these key elements and as such , must be interdisciplinary .
The network focuses specifically on populations for whom few effective HIV/STI interventions currently exist , such as men who have sex with men ( MSM ) , criminal justice-affected populations , minority youth , and young couples .
He argues that in order to fully understand the sexual health and HIV prevention challenges that sexual migrants confront , it is necessary to pay close attention to the effects of the shifts in social and cultural context that they experience as a result of their transnational relocation .
He currently conducts research on the paradoxes of the modern notion of sexual identity .
In the book , the author argues that in order to fully understand the sexual health and HIV prevention challenges that sexual migrants confront , it is necessary to pay close attention to the effects of the shifts in social and cultural context that they experience as a result of their transnational relocation .
He closely examine the dynamics of their sexual and romantic relations in the U.S. , including how their sexual partners are sometimes supportive and other times become a source of oppression that generate vulnerabilities for gay immigrants .
The book is primarily about sexual migration , the immigrants ’ sexualities , and the shifts in sexualities that result from migration , but also argues that all those topics are essential for understanding the contextual and structural factors that may result in HIV risk ( or alternatively in forms of collective empowerment and resiliency ) in the process of immigrant incorporation .

What are genitals ?
Remember , again , that a child 's questions are about science , not sex !
Even very young children discover that the genitals can create pleasurable feelings when they are touched ... it 's not a secret !
Also , telling children that grownups bring their bodies close together in this way just because they enjoy it , not only to make babies , will prevent them from assuming that sexual intimacy is only for baby-making -- an idea they 'll have to unlearn later on .
Sperm can come out of the penis and be put together with an egg that a doctor removes from an ovary in a special dish they keep in their office .
Another way is for the doctor or another person to take sperm -- which comes out of the penis inside fluid called semen -- and place it inside a vagina .
It needs to push the fetus out of the uterus and then into the vagina and then out of an opening at the end of the vagina that 's in between the person 's legs .
If they are not able to come out through the vagina , babies can be delivered in another way with a doctor 's help .
Written by acclaimed human sexuality educator and author Deborah Roffman , MS , The Science of Babies is truly revolutionary in its approach .
They don ’ t suck , they ’ re just boring .
How times have changed , for better for worse is a matter of discussion but when 10-year-old girls become so self obsessed they want an operation to correct suppose defects in their vagina , I think we can say the trend has mostly been downwards .
I am continuing my association with it as an experiment and start my day with deleting the half-dozen or so skimpily dressed young ladies who recommend a site of their friend who is probably even more skimpily dressed and prostituting themselves , taking advantage of the loneliness and needs of their opposite sex .
Yet it is not so much a wonder as a testimony to the blinders we all wear when it comes to temptation , especially sexual temptation and the temptation to be fashionable .
An important component of this cultural shift—and so an important component of what Modernism sought to justify—was sexual license , including promiscuity , contraception , abortion , and homosexuality .
But it was not just sexual ; it was all of a piece .
Even before he was elected Pope , Cardinal Ratzinger gradually took on a greater role in ecclesiastical discipline , most notably by winning control for his Congregation over cases of sexual abuse so that swifter and more decisive action could be taken .
Third , a world that desperately wants the Church to admit the goodness of sexual promiscuity and same-sex attraction still draws the line at the sexual abuse of children by adults , and especially by hypocrites in the Church .
He was also a brilliant philosopher who was able to reframe the Church ’ s understanding of sexuality in a way that substitutes for prescriptivism a deeper understanding of the nature and ends of the human person .
Sex-specific evaluation and treatment is appropriate for children and teenagers who have or are developing a sexual interest in younger children and for adults who have or are developing a sexual interest in children .
Sex-specific specialists are also skilled at evaluating and treating men and women who may be sex addicts , having multiple affairs , voyeurs ( window-peepers ) , exhibitionists ( flashers ) , or who have sexual fetishes ( a sexual obsession with a material object or a nonsexual part of the body ) .
If a teenager or adult is having sexual thoughts or fantasies that involve children , an evaluation with a sex-specific therapist is very appropriate .
A sex-specific therapist can determine the seriousness of the problem and can teach the client skills to redirect his or her sexual interest toward age-appropriate partners .
There is generally a period of time where a person is thinking about being sexual with children , but before the person acts on it .
A sex-specific evaluation is also appropriate for children or teenagers who are exhibiting persistent inappropriate sexual behaviors .
A sex-specific therapist can determine whether the behaviors are related to normal childhood sexual experimentation and are not a cause for concern or whether the behaviors are something more problematic .
Talk therapy is generally not effective for people who have or are developing a sexual interest in children .
In addition , state laws add a third instance in which the therapist must break confidentiality : if the therapist suspects that a known child is being sexually abused .
It ’ s the same process in interviewing and treating people with a sexual interest in children .
If the client says “ I have continual sex fantasies of little girls , I have strong urges to do sexual things with little girls , ” the therapist has nothing to report to Child Protective Services ( CPS ) .
However , if the client says , “ I sexually touched my cousin Johnny Smith , ” then the therapist must report .
At the beginning of the first appointment , a sex-specific therapist will ask you to read and sign a consent form that outlines your state ’ s reporting laws and clarifies that you understand the law that requires therapists to report child sexual abuse .
Similar laws exist in all 50 states requiring therapists , physicians , schoolteachers , and other professionals , to report to Child Protective Services or the police , if they suspect that a known child is being sexually abused .
Upon release to the community following a conviction for a registerable offense , the sex offender is required to register with the Division of Criminal Justice Services .
Because the risk level reflects factors unique to a particular sex offender , offenders convicted of the same offense may receive different risk levels .
In addition to the risk level , the court also determines whether the offender should be designated a sexual predator , a sexually violent offender or a predicate sex offender .

I get it , people see the word `` essay , '' and they think , `` Yikes , boring , '' but do n't paint some of us with that brush just because you 've read so much shitty , boring work , taught to you by boring -- and perhaps shitty -- people .

And so , one of the things is , the illustrator has doubled down and said , “ There ’ s nothing about race or sex going on in this cartoon. ” And I think that the critique of this is spot-on .
But I think that that cartoon , in and of itself , is emblematic of so much of the reason why this conversation occurs around Serena , because she has acted as a conduit for these conversations about race and sex together .
And I think it 's interesting , because it comes on the heels just mere months out from a massive report about sexism in the upper echelons of Nike that has resulted in the ouster of many top Nike officials and has a forthcoming lawsuit from women who feel like they ’ ve been targets of sexism and sexual harassment within the corporation .

Truth & Liberty Coalition Report : The Harmful Effects of Pornography The Harmful Effects of Pornography report cover Data on use and impact on families and communities included We have compiled some of the best research on the topic from leading sources—including official agencies and nonprofit organizations. ” — Richard Harris , executive director , Truth & Liberty Coalition WOODLAND PARK , COLORADO , UNITED STATES , March 14 , 2022 /EINPresswire.com/ -- A recent report released by the Truth & Liberty Coalition shows the harmful psychological , relational and social effects from pornography .
Men who use porn are trained to see women as objects to be used for sexual gratification , rather than equal persons created by God .
Viewing pornography increases the likelihood of seeking sex outside of marriage , which also increases the risk of sexually transmitted diseases and out-of-wedlock pregnancies .
Statistics show that kids raised in a home where a parent uses pornography are at increased risk of experiencing unhealthy sexual behavior , marital conflict , and parental neglect .
While three quarters of parents deny their children have seen it , the data shows that by the time they reach 17 , more than three quarters of teens have viewed pornography .
• Pornography attacks the dignity of men and women who are created in the image of God , also distorting God ’ s gift of sex which should be shared only within the bounds of marriage .
Harris believes that Christians need to take a stand against pornography .
“ We must advocate for legislation that protects young people from internet pornography , keeps sexually oriented businesses out of neighborhoods , and gets sexualized materials out of public schools. ” he said .
“ We must support entertainment that affirms wholesome sexual values and oppose that which does not. “ Distribution channels : Culture , Society & Lifestyle , Education , Human Rights , Religion , Science

You can , in fact , improve your sexual performance and last a lot longer in the sack , with the proper technique .
All you need is your penis , a woman and the will to learn .

Have your girlfriend play with the bits of skin surrounding your penis ( the bum , the inside of your thighs , the abs ) .

In sentencing D convicted of failing to register as a sex offender , district court did not plainly err in imposing a special condition of supervised release prohibiting D from “ residing or going to places where a minor or minors are known to frequent without prior approval of the probation officer , ” especially given D ’ s repeated failure to comply with registration requirements and the fact that the probation officer could authorize D to go such places in appropriate instances .

Federal Corner : The Fifth Amendment and Sexual History Polygraphs – By F. R. Buck Files Jr. On May 10 , 2016 , a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that a defendant faced some danger of self-incrimination if he was required to answer mandatory questions during a sex offender history polygraph ; and , the government ’ s threat to seek revocation of the defendant ’ s supervised release constituted an unconstitutional compulsion to submit to such a polygraph under the Fifth Amendment .
A Synopsis of the Facts of the Case I thought I heard you say , “ Hold still little catfish—all I want to do is gut ya ! ” That could have been the reaction of Bureau of Prisons inmate Brian Von Behren when he learned that the government had requested several new conditions of supervised release , and that one of them would require him to participate and successfully complete a sex offender treatment program .
At the time that he received this news , Von Behren was close to completing a 121-month sentence for the receipt and distribution of child pornography and faced a term of three years supervised release .
One of the SOMB Guidelines mandated that Von Behren sign a non-negotiable treatment agreement requiring him to complete a non-deceptive sexual history polygraph .
I hereby instruct RSA , Inc. to report to any appropriate authority or authorities any occurrence or potential occurrence of any sexual offense on my part regardless of how RSA , Inc. gains knowledge of such occurrence or potential occurrence .
United States District Judge Robert E. Blackburn of the District of Colorado reviewed the RSA contract and held that the successful completion of a sex offender treatment program would be a condition of Von Behren ’ s supervised release ; however , he sustained Von Behren ’ s Fifth Amendment objection to any requirement that he admit to any criminal offense other than his offense of conviction .
In spite of Judge Blackburn ’ s order , RSA informed Von Behren that he would either submit to a sexual history polygraph or leave the program .
He was advised that the polygraph examination would include four mandatory questions : After the age of 18 , did you engage in sexual activity with any­one under the age of 15 ?
Have you had sexual contact with a family member or relative ?
Have you ever physically forced or threatened anyone to engage in sexual contact with you ?
Have you ever had sexual contact with someone who was physically asleep or unconscious ?
On January 27 , 2015 , after reviewing the four questions that would be asked , Judge Blackburn reconsidered his earlier ruling , denied Von Behren ’ s request for relief and ordered him to complete the sexual history polygraph .
The government also advised Judge Blackburn that it would seek an order remanding Von Behren to prison if he did not successfully complete the sex offender treatment program .
Von Behren contends the district court erred when it held that one of his conditions of supervised release , a sexual polygraph examination with four mandatory questions , did not violate the Fifth Amendment ’ s privilege against self-incrimination .
Three of RSA ’ s mandatory questions ask for the admission of a felony : ( 1 ) “ After the age of 18 , did you engage in sexual activity with anyone under the age of 15 ? ” ; ( 2 ) “ Have you ever physically forced or threatened anyone to engage in sexual contact with you ? ” ; and ( 3 ) “ Have you ever had sexual contact with someone who was physically asleep or unconscious ? ” The fourth mandatory question asks about sexual contact with a family member , which acts to limit the possible pool of victims .
Von Behren ’ s answers to these questions would reveal past sex crimes .
If there were presently an investigation looking into the commission of a sex crime , and if Mr .
Von Behren differently if they were made aware that he had physically forced someone to engage in sexual relations with him .
Von Behren if he were ever charged with a sex crime .
Von Behren were to answer yes to the underage sex question or the physical force question , those answers could be used against him to show he has a propensity to commit such bad acts .
Von Behren ’ s contract with RSA that instructs RSA “ to report to any appropriate authority or authorities any occurrence or potential occurrence of any sexual offense. ” Rec. , vol .
Because the answers to the four mandatory questions could focus an investigation—otherwise ignorant of his past sex crimes—on Mr .
Von Behren faces at least some authentic danger of self-incrimination by answering three of the four mandatory questions in the RSA ’ s sexual history polygraph .
Compulsion After concluding in its final order that RSA ’ s sexual polygraph questions do not pose a real and appreciable risk of incrimination to Mr .
Von Behren ’ s remand to prison if he refused to answer incriminating sexual polygraph questions because that refusal would ( and did ) ultimately result in his termination from the sex offender treatment program .
See United States v. York , 357 F.3d 14 , 24–25 ( 1st Cir.2004 ) ( recognizing it “ would be constitutionally problematic ” if supervised release provision requiring sex offender treatment “ require [ d ] York to submit to polygraph testing .
Over the years , I have had defendants in both federal and state cases who were required to submit to sex offender history polygraphs .

New Delhi | October 18 , 2018 19:01 IST Renuka Shahane will be a member of the sexual harassment committee formed by CINTAA .
# MeToo ’ s India chapter has come like a reckoning for many but actor Renuka Shahane says there are still uncountable , unknown stories of women who have faced sexual harassment and abuse that are waiting to be heard .
The actor , who unfailingly voices her opinions on important issues on social media , was recently announced as a member of an advisory committee by CINTAA ( Cine And TV Artistes ’ Association ) to tackle sexual harassment in the industry , where the movement first began with Tanushree Dutta reiterating her decade-old harassment story against Nana Patekar .
Many more names have followed since with people like Alok Nath , Sajid Khan , Subhash Ghai , Kailash Kher and Rajat Kapoor being accused of sexual harassment and in some cases of rape .
Shahane , 53 , says she did not face any sexual harassment in the industry but “ it ’ s just a matter of luck ” .
Tara writer-producer Vinta Nanda has accused Nath of sexual harassment and rape from almost two decades ago .
The actor says now the people who have faced sexual harassment in the industry will have a place to go to where they can be heard .

It ’ s also fucking dangerous to go a bit against the grain in these cases , when everyone has already made their interpretation and signed the verdict .
1 One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me saying , “ Come , I will show you the judgment of the great whore who sits on the many waters , 2 with whom the kings of the earth fornicated ; and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication. ” 3 So he took me away in spirit to a wilderness .
Two weeks ago we identified the whore as being Jerusalem .
Last week we looked at why Jerusalem 's leadership was seen as being a whore - there was literal fornication , spiritual fornication , and political prostitution .
We will analyze Jerusalem 's leadership under three headings - the beautiful appearance of the whore , the specific sins for which the whore is being judged , and the remedy for those who were seduced by the whore or at least who were unduly impressed by her .
The whore 's beautiful adornments cover a world of iniquity But the first thing we see is that this whore was not ugly .
[ 1 ] It 's almost a verbatim quote , which would make the first century reader immediately connect the whore with the Sadducees who ruled from the temple .
He was calling the political leadership of Jerusalem the whore of Babylon .
[ 3 ] So just as a whore dresses to allure and to cover over that which is unattractive , the clothing of the Sadducees was a symbol of how they used pretended-spirituality to cover over their evils .
So it is becoming less surprising that overt idolatry was happening rather than simply sexual abominations - though sexual abominations and filthiness is rationalized quite frequently in the Talmud , with long articles on which prurient activities with your children constitute incest and which ones do not ; or which sexual activities with your neighbor 's wife constitute adultery and which ones do not .
And so it was not surprising to see those demonized leaders engaging the most outrageous kinds of sexual impurity .
Occultism and sexual impurity seem to go hand in hand .
Over the last several decades many people in high positions of power in our nation have been involved in both occultism and perverse sexuality .
He shows how those that he works with in Washington DC become far more vulnerable to sexual perversion than those who are not in power .
1-3 ) The next charge against the whore is the word `` fornication '' which harks back to verses 1-3 - the harlotry that these leaders engaged in .
How to resist the whore 's seductiveness Listen to God 's warning ( v. 7a ) And verse 7 gives us two things that help us to not get sucked in by the seductive grandeur of political speeches and to not make an idol of America 's greatness .
By analogy , we have a tendency to easily see the evils of the Soviet Empire , Hitler 's Nazi Germany , or Robert Mugabe 's rape of his nation through inflationary banking .
Analyze the whore and the beast from God 's perspective ( v. 7b ) But the second thing that can keep us from being seduced by our nation 's political prostitution is to analyze the whore and the beast from God 's perspective .

Sildenafil Teva is used to treat adult men with erectile dysfunction ( sometimes called impotence ) , when they can not get or keep a hard penis ( erection ) sufficient for satisfactory sexual activity .
For Sildenafil Teva to be effective , sexual stimulation is required .

Former prep school student acquitted of felony rape in split verdict CONCORD , NH – A New Hampshire jury on Friday convicted Owen Labrie of five counts — including one felony — in connection with the sexual assault of another student at a prestigious boarding school , but it acquitted him of more serious charges .
Labrie was convicted of a felony charge and four misdemeanors : the most serious count being the use of an online service or the Internet to seduce , solicit or entice a child under age of 16 in order to a commit sexual assault .
He also was convicted of three counts of misdemeanor sexual assault and child endangerment .
Labrie , who will have to register for inclusion on the sex offender list , was released on bail .
But he was acquitted of three counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault — punishable by 10 to 20 years in prison — as well as simple assault , a misdemeanor .
In a statement , the victim ’ s family said : “ A a measure of justice has been served for victims of sexual violence .
There is no joy in this outcome , however , as our daughter can never get back what she has lost nor can St. Paul ’ s School ever be our community again. ” In the statement , the family said it felt “ betrayed that St. Paul ’ s School allowed and fostered a toxic culture that left our daughter and other students at risk to sexual violence .
In closing arguments , prosecutor Joseph Cherniske told the jury that the defendant carefully planned out a sexual assault and viewed the taking of the girl ’ s virginity as a source of pride .
“ It wasn ’ t the school ’ s fault , ” he said , rebutting the defense argument that St. Paul ’ s encouraged a tradition known as the “ Senior Salute ” in which seniors sought to have sexual encounters with younger students .
“ The idea that you would wink at a tradition that ‘ Senior Salute ’ represents is shocking , ” he said , denying that his client sexually penetrated the girl .
“ I thought I was going to have sex with this girl , ” he said , but after getting the condom , he testified , he changed his mind .
“ It wouldn ’ t have been a good move to have sex with this girl , ” he told the court .
Her testimony The accuser , now 16 , testified last week that Labrie penetrated her with his fingers before raping her .
The prosecution repeatedly questioned him about telling friends after the encounter that he had sex with the girl .
He didn ’ t tell police about it , he said , because their questions focused on whether the two had sex .
State criminalist Katie Swango said semen and sperm were found on the young woman ’ s underwear .
Labrie testified they were terms used loosely that could mean a range of activities , from kissing to sex .
Labrie called the girl and her sister “ angels , ” the detective said , and insisted he would never have had sex with her because of her age .
But soon he began to grope her .

Japan has no law prohibiting racial , ethnic , or religious discrimination , or discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity .
Protests erupted across Japan this year after a string of rape cases resulted in acquittals .
Japan ’ s rape law requires that prosecutors prove that violence or intimidation was involved , or that the victim was “ incapable of resistance. ” In one case , a court acquitted a father accused of raping his 19-year-old daughter , although the court recognized that the sex was non-consensual and that he had been physically and sexually abusing the victim since she was younger .

Macron ’ s new government grapples with rape allegations against minister Damien Abad denies allegations made in a news report at the weekend .
Damien Abad , France 's newly appointed minister for solidarity and disabled people , is facing rape accusations from two women | Ludovic Marin/AFP via Getty Images Damien Abad , France ’ s newly appointed minister for solidarity and disabled people , is facing intense scrutiny following accusations of rape from two women , as first revealed in an investigation by French news outlet Mediapart on Saturday .

Abad strongly denied the allegations on Sunday , saying that his arthrogryposis , a condition that affects the limbs , would make it physically impossible for him to commit rape .

“ I started to feel resentment toward them , and anger entered my heart. ” Shelley became more involved in the party scene , and by age 16 , she was sexually active , drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana .
He told Shelley he knew a man who would pay her to have sex with him .
Soon Shelley moved in with a madam and worked as a professional escort making “ very good money ” on and off for eight years while continuing to work as a prostitute and exotic dancer .
She found herself having bizarre sex with strangers .

And she says the devil told her , “ See Shelley , I will make you famous , and THEN everyone will love you. ” PORN AFFECTS MARRIAGES Shelley says watching porn with your spouse will not make for a healthier marriage .
She wonders why you would want marriage advice from the “ mentally ill and physically diseased ? ” According to her stats , over 66 percent of the porn actors carry the herpes virus with many having Chlamydia and seven percent being HIV positive .
It is standard to have sexual diseases in the porn industry .
Shelley says most often women begin to watch porn to please their spouses and also from the fear of losing their spouse .
Women are usually more addicted to cyber sex found in chat rooms than to watching porn movies .
At that time Shelley had no idea of what she calls the “ porn pandemic. ” She is the only former porn actress that she knows that is publicly speaking out as a committed Christian .
Now she gets thousands of hits each month on her site – many from sex addicts , Christians , and even from ministers .

The benefits of sex life for women Main problems When they lose their virginity The danger of late virginity Is the norm achieved Effect on the psyche About deflowering Religious motives Benefits of sex for women Even though Orthodoxy is actively lobbied in Russia , progress does not stand still , and sex education continues .
In particular , the benefits of sexual activity for women are evaluated .
Ever since the sexual revolution thundered , girls began to choose at what age it is better to lose their virginity .
There are many supporters of sexual freedoms .
According to official figures , girls in modern society do not seek to have sexual relations as early as possible .
Only 15 % have their first sexual contact during adolescence .
As a rule , girls use this experience to awaken sexuality in themselves , to awaken attraction .
After it , most often there is a long abstinence , since they have not matured before leading a full sexual life .
After the first sexual intercourse , they have a lull .
And full-fledged sexual contacts begin at 17-20 , when they enter new educational institutions .
As a rule , residents of Russian cities at 22 already have sexual experience , several partners .
Also , for some reason , male representatives have a mistrust towards those who at that age have not yet had sexual intercourse .
Male avoids contact with females , whose sexuality doubts .
For this reason , those who are excluded from sex , they consider suspicious and unattractive .
And he understands that with the onset of sexual activity , their studies and work will suffer .
In Russian society , there is a myth that girls begin their sexual life early .
Until the age of 16 , 1 out of 4 schoolchildren entered into sexual contact , and in the student environment - every second .
The fact is that sexual contact at an early age is harmful to the body .
The hymen protects the body from infections during the formation of microflora in the vagina .
Also , the epithelium in the vagina during adolescence is thin .
For this reason , it will not be difficult to injure him during sex .
The myth is the opinion that in the absence of sexual life and the gynecologist does not need to go .
A virgin at 25 should remember that the first sexual intercourse is painful .
And if the pain and blood stay longer than 2 days , this is a direct indication for visiting a gynecologist - perhaps the walls of the vagina have torn .
It is a myth that it is impossible to get pregnant during the first sexual contact .
And if it opens , this is followed by a lecture on how sex is necessary for he alth and a proposal to `` solve the problem . ''
They communicate with representatives of the opposite sex , but they don ’ t represent themselves in an intimate relationship with anyone , it ’ s even unpleasant for them to do this , and communication doesn ’ t go beyond kisses .
And some women believe that sex before marriage leads to problems .
It is widely believed that casual sex is dangerous , and such women are afraid to have sex before marriage .
And often such late virgins have stories of how they quarreled with their suitors on the basis of sex .
In addition , sex is a natural physiological act , and its role for the body is great .
According to statistics , a woman with a regular sexual life is less likely to suffer from flu viruses , colds .
And also for those who regularly have sex , the mood rises .
A full sex life provokes the production of collagen , as well as the hormone progesterone , which make the skin supple .

National March for Sex Workers ’ Rights 2008 Stop Shaming Us to Death In the past two years we ’ ve seen two women commit suicide after high-profile sex scandals related to politicians .
We are outraged that those who provide services , especially women , including transgender women carry the burden of sexual shame and punishment in our society while the very people who use our services are creating and enforcing legislation that violates our human rights .
Furthermore , we are frustrated that the media emphasizes violence against female sex workers while ignoring the homophobia and transphobia that fuel violence against men and trans people in our community .
When he was finally apprehended he was quoted as saying : “ I thought I could get away with killing hookers because nobody cares about them… I was doing the cops a favor by cleaning the trash up off the street. ” It is clear that labeling sex workers as criminals puts us at odds with law enforcement who should be protecting us and it sends a message to society that sex workers are expendable .

Some women may never enjoy the sensation of cervical stimulation , but for others it can be an instant orgasm hot-button !
The tiny opening found there is designed to let semen in and blood out , and that ’ s about it .
Any kind of bacteria or other material forced through the opening can cause great damage – in fact , this is why health professionals discourage any kind of penetrative “ thrusting ” sex in the pool or the bath , because chlorinated water can be awfully painful and damaging to the interior of the uterus .
In the first 10-14 days after the onset of menstruation , and the last 7-10 of an average 28 day cycle , it is likely that contact with the cervix will result in painful sex .
If you find that you are hitting her cervix every time you engage in intercourse , be sure you are engaging in enough foreplay .
These options are particularly helpful if low libido is also an issue , since her natural ovulatory cycle encourages an increase in stimulating sex hormones .
Cervical mucus is produced by the body , making the vagina and uterus a habitable pH level receptive to sperm .
This process not only prepares her body for conception , but can also make it not just less painful but incredibly erotic to enjoy light cervical stimulation .
You may find that while direct stimulation of the cervical opening still feels strange or even painful , there is likely to be a spot to the side of the cervix which can produce almost immediate orgasm .

Weinstein jury indicates it is split on most serious counts Harvey Weinstein arrived at a Manhattan court as jury deliberations continue in his rape trial , today , in New York .
NEW YORK > > The jury deliberating in Harvey Weinstein ’ s rape trial indicated today that it is deadlocked on the most serious charges .
In a note sent to the judge during their lunch break , jurors posed a question asking if it were permissible for them to be hung on two counts of predatory sexual assault while reaching a unanimous verdict on other charges .
The jury , in its fourth day of deliberations , has been particularly focused on the key aspect of both predatory sexual assault counts : “ Sopranos ” actress Annabella Sciorra ’ s allegations that Weinstein raped and forcibly performed oral sex on her in the mid-1990s .
Sciorra , now 59 , was the first accuser to testify and took the witness stand nearly a month ago , telling jurors how the once-powerful movie mogul showed up unexpectedly at the door of her Manhattan apartment before barging in and raping and forcibly performing oral sex on her in late 1993 or early 1994 .
“ He was frightening. ” Weinstein , 67 , is charged with five counts stemming from the allegations of Sciorra and two other women — an aspiring actress who says he raped her in March 2013 and a former film and TV production assistant , Mimi Haleyi , who says he forcibly performed oral sex on her in March 2006 .
Sciorra ’ s accusations are key to the most serious charges that jurors are weighing in the case — two counts of predatory sexual assault , which carry a maximum penalty of life in prison .
The charge requires prosecutors to show that a defendant committed a prior rape or other sex crime , but doesn ’ t have the statue of limitation constraints that would bar her allegations from consideration on their own .
Weinstein ’ s lawyers fought to get her nixed from the case in the run-up to the trial , arguing to no avail that prosecutors shouldn ’ t be allowed to use her claims because they predated the enactment of the predatory sexual assault charge in 2006 .

The return of rape as a distinct crime ?
Conservative Rob Anders , a Calgary MP , is proposing to have the word “ rape ” entrenched into the criminal code and enforce a tough mandatory minimum sentence for those convicted of the crime .
Anders and some feminists believe that sexual assault is an ambiguous term and does not fully capture the severity and brutal nature of the crime .
Anders argues that the term “ sexual assault ” in Canada ’ s legal system and in the Criminal Code can be historically traced back to the 1980s , where feminists campaigned for the term because they believed that those who committed sexual assault would get the same type of penalties as rapists .
This happened , the Calgary MP argued , because those committing sexual assault , such as groping , and those committing rape , were lumped together and put in the same legal category .
Parliament removed “ rape ” from the Criminal Code in an attempt to reform the way the law dealt with violence against women as a varying degree of severity of sexual assault took its place .
Proponents of this legal change argued that they would empower and allow prosecutors to pursue a wider range of sexual violence against women .
The call to revive the now-defunct rape charge has gained traction in some circles and revitalized the discourse on how the legal system has perhaps not been able to deal distinguish sexual assault cases and has failed to harshly punish serious offenders .
Edward Prutschi , a Legal Analyst for News Talk 1010 and partner at Bytensky Prutschi Shikhman , discussed this firestorm set off by the Calgary MP about legally bringing back the term “ rape. ” Mr. Prutschi says that the oft-mentioned argument that sexual assault is not tantamount to rape and tries to diminish the seriousness of the crime is untrue .
Often times , in police reports or in the courtroom , the seriousness of the sexual assault is highlighted and emphasized by the Crown and authorities .
To bring back “ rape ” as a term , on this ground , is not without difficulties .
Mr. Prutschi emphasizes that the rationale for a global term of sexual assault is also problematic .
As a defense lawyer , when a client is charged with sexual assault , such as inappropriate touching , the severity of the crime may be exaggerated in court because all types of sexual assault , including the most severe cases , are clustered and lumped together .
While sexual assault is a serious crime , within it , there are different degrees and all sexual assault charges should not be treated the same way .
Furthermore , there is nothing preventing the prosecutors and police from emphasizing the seriousness of a sexual assault charge , and all cases ought to be treated differently .

The students , organizing under the name “ Fire The Abusers , ” entered Sarkar ’ s class while it was in progress and stood in front of the classroom holding a banner as one of them spoke , describing allegations of sexual misconduct against Sarkar , complaining about the university ’ s handling of the complaints , and calling for students to take action .
According to an article last year in The Chronicle of Higher Education : Sarkar was found responsible for violating Title IX policy after complaints that he propositioned students to pose nude for photos , among other things .
According to the Austin American-Statesman , “ in a memo to the provost , Sarkar denied many of the allegations , although he admitted discussing the possibility of one of the complainants posing nude as a paid model. ” ( See also this . )
The protest followed the publication , last month , of an editorial in the school ’ s student newspaper , The Daily Texan , that called for students to “ stand together as a community to protect ourselves and our peers ” from professors who “ have committed sexual misconduct against students. ” According to that editorial , there were 44 reports of sexual misconduct filed against faculty and staff at UT Austin during the 2016-17 school year ; six of the reports led to findings of violations of university policy .

Hemorrhoids , commonly known as ‘ piles ’ are veins in the rectum and anus that get swollen and inflamed , usually as a result of constipation .
Symptoms include pain , bleeding during bowel movements , itching around the anus , difficulty sitting and sometimes a swelling felt near the anus .
Hemorrohoids are classified as internal or external , based on their location in the rectum and anal canal .
Diagnosis : There are other more serious conditions which lead to rectal bleeding like colorectal cancer and anal cancer .
Your doctor may perform a digital rectal examination or a proctoscopy to visually inspect the rectum and anus .

It has previously been argued that the penalization of simple pimping is unconstitutional , according to principles of sexual freedom and neutrality of the Penal Law in respect to sexual morality .
To legalize would go against the position of the Portuguese State , as I have described before ; To legalize would mean that the State considers prostitution to be just another profession , derived from a free choice that dignifies the human person ; The sexual exploitation of another person would cease to be thought of as a criminal activity and it would have the same recognition as any other work activity , subjected to the same labor and fiscal regime ; But we know this is a complex reality and we can not hide the fact that its often situations of extreme need , social exclusion and lack of opportunities that lead to contexts of sexual exploitation .
Therefore , that “ free choice ” is always mitigated by these constraints ; It is not an accident that most networks of sexual exploitation have as main source areas , countries or regions filled with misery and lack of opportunities ; The question of the legal standing of prostitution involves other , broader questions related to the relation between the Law and Ethics , between self-determination and the dignity of the human person .

Even at age 50 , Wells was so magnetizing that every beautiful and intelligent 20-year-old woman he met threw herself at him and demanded a sexual affair , and he was happy to oblige .

In addition to this , somehow he manages to marry the only two women of his age he knows who do n't like sex .
He writes easily , and is often described as going off to spend an entire morning , or indeed a hermetic span of weeks , doing nothing but writing , but we the readers hardly ever see him doing it , the way we see him having the even more private activity of sex .
This is a weird imbalance I 've seen in other novels relating the sex life of writers or indeed anybody who does something other than have sex .
Usually the sex is the only part described in detail , although at least here you get the social reform activity too .
Wells had generated a lot of controversy for depicting extramarital affairs in some of his novels , but the book 's summary of his later novel The History of Mr. Polly , a comedy featuring arson , insurance fraud , faked death , and other shenanigans , concludes : `` It was the most immoral story [ Wells ] had ever written , but the British public received it without a murmur of disapproval because there was n't a word in it about sex . ''
One more thing about the sex .
It is commonplace these days to describe self-declared `` incels '' as men who believe that beautiful women owe them sex , and to mock them for this absurd self-aggrandizement .

1 ( Jan. 3 , 2019 ) , Scott Whitworth The Court reviewed whether a district court ’ s decision to allow the State to introduce prior incidents of uncharged sexual acts as evidence of the defendant ’ s propensity for committing sexual offenses violated NRS 48.045 ( 3 ) and concluded such evidence as long as it is first evaluated for relevance and its heightened risk of unfair prejudice .
83 ( Oct. 25 , 2018 ) , Arthur Burn The Court determined that ( 1 ) a district court must perform a comprehensive three-step analysis when a defendant challenges the use of race in peremptory strikes and that ( 2 ) a district court should hold a hearing when a defendant seeks to admit evidence showing that a minor victim could have contrived sexual abuse allegations .

Since 1999 , HIV prevalence has declined among direct and indirect sex workers , although levels remain high .
However , positive outcomes could easily be reversed with the introduction of the 2008 Law on the Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation , which has resulted in the closure of brothels and a growing number of direct sex workers shifting to entertainment establishments , [ in which condoms may be forbidden ] making effective prevention interventions targeting sex workers and their clients much more difficult .

Changes in sexual behaviour that reduce the number of new HIV infections will not become apparent through changes in HIV prevalence until some time after the behaviour change takes place .
One common indicator of condom use , the UNGASS indicator ( condom use at last higher risk sex of those aged 15-24 ) , has been chosen to illustrate how changes in the proportion of people who report using condoms do not always explain changes in the size of the group who had high risk behaviour .
Indicators based on the proportion of the whole population who have sex without using a condom would be better measures of the size of the group at highest risk of HIV infection .

Ironically , his regressive remarks on the LGBT ( lesbians , gays , bisexual and transgenders ) community came close to the heels of right minded people celebrating the second anniversary of the landmark Delhi High Court judgment which , upholding the principles of equality and freedom as enshrined in our Constitution , had annulled a 150-year-old law criminalizing `` carnal intercourse against the order of nature . ''
On July 2 , 2009 , a division bench of Chief Justice A.P Shah and Justice S. Murlidhar struck down provisions of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code which criminalized gay sex among consenting adults , saying that ‘ it violated the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution , and that the inclusiveness that Indian society traditionally displayed , literally in every aspect of life , is manifest in recognizing a role in society for everyone .

Countries that have non-discrimination laws against men who have sex with men , injecting drug users and sex workers have provided better access to HIV prevention , treatment , care and support services. ’ The minister 's statements go against the stand taken by the Government 's own National AIDS Control Organization ( NACO ) , which reacted sharply : `` How can this be a disease ?
It is just a form of sexual orientation .
Dr Michel Sidibe , Executive Director of the Joint United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS ( UNAIDS ) clarified , `` India 's rich tradition of inclusivity and social justice must include men who have sex with men and transgender people .
There is no place for stigma and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation .
The 2010 UNAIDS report on the global AIDS epidemic found that among the high-risk group that got HIV infection in India last year — 9.2 % were intravenous drug users , MSMs ( 7.3 % ) and female sex workers ( 4.9 % ) .
It is as much a duty of the ruling political party , as it is of Mr Azad ( the word azad means ‘ free ’ but he seems to be actually a prisoner of a diseased mind ) , to remember that that discrimination is antithesis of equality and that it is the recognition of equality which will foster the dignity of every individual , despite her/his sexual orientations .

Why the Construction Industry is Taking A New Look at Women in the Workforce The current labor shortage and increased awareness of sexual harassment are causing the construction industry to take a new look at how it recruits and retains women in the workforce .
Providing a safe and healthy work environment also means providing a workplace that is free from sexual discrimination .
It ’ s also important to create a workplace that does not allow sexual harassment .
To avoid legal , morale and reputational damage , employers should do the following : Create and enforce a written policy that defines and prohibits sexual harassment .
Create a procedure for reporting sexual harassment .
Respond promptly and thoroughly to complaints of sexual harassment and take appropriate action against offenders .
Never retaliate against employees for reporting sexual harassment or respond to complaints dismissively .
Provide sexual harassment training , especially to supervisors , after an incident or as required by state law .

But , did you know there is a recent rise in concern over what kind of plastics your sex toys are made of ?
Phthalates are found in many common products , from sex toys , to car parts , to medical products because of the cost effective and easy to work with nature of the product .
But , the newest media hype about phthalates surrounds their use in sex toys .
Until fairly recently most soft sex toys have been manufactured out of various combinations of rubber , plastic , latex , and vinyl , with various additives for texture , color , and flexibility .
The most common commonly produced sex toys containing phthalates are those listed as “ jelly plastic ” or “ jelly rubber ” , so they are generating the most concern .
Also until fairly recently , there have been few soft plastic toys ( sex toys or otherwise ) that are made without phthalates .
This makes it non-porous , hypoallergenic , and inert , which is a very good thing in a sex toy .
Another increasingly popular and always beautiful alternative to plastic or silicone sex toys is the glass dildo .
Glass is a hypoallergenic , sanitary material that has a long history of use in creating erotic and beautiful sex toys .
The lightest touch of lubricant creates a smooth gliding sensation – and you can even toss your glass sex toy into the dishwasher to clean it !
Because most sex toys are sold with the disclaimer that they are novelties , they are not governed by FDA rules the way foods and cosmetics are .
If you find that your body reacts to jelly plastic , or you simply don ’ t feel comfortable with sex toys that may contain phthalates , choose silicone or glass toys instead .
Phthalates are present in nearly all plastic consumer goods , however if you would like to limit your exposure to phthalates in your use of adult sex toys take care to wash all jelly toys carefully before use ( which you should ALWAYS do anyhow !
Using a condom over a sex toy makes it that much easier to wash and keep sanitary .
If you find that a toy you have not played with in a while has changed color , begun to melt , leak , or otherwise change drastically while tucked away , consider abandoning it for a newer model ( you can recycle sex toys you no longer want though Scarlet Girl ’ s Sexstainability program ) .
So , if you use your sex toys frequently and decide to limit your daily exposure to phthalates in this particular area , you do not have to give up on pleasure .
You still have the option of choosing a silicone or glass sex toy , or covering jelly plastic toys with a condom .

Birth Certificates — The statute does allow for an amended birth certificate if the person applying for such has had “ a sex change operation ” ( sex reassignment surgery ) and a note from their doctor saying as much .
However , it ignores some of the realities of sex reassignment surgery — that it can actually be a number of surgeries , that it comes with risks ( e.g. , general anesthetic ) that can make it unworkable for some people , that it ’ s expensive and generally not covered by insurance , that providers are few and far between .
Additionally , a birth certificate is one of the most common primary forms of identification for obtaining an Arizona driver ’ s license or state identification card — and it can be critical for individuals to have ID that matches their gender presentation , even if sex reassignment surgery has not been completed ( if it ’ s even something the individual wants in the first place ) .

What is being called “ Egypt ’ s # MeToo movement ” has made headlines around the world since 2020 , with high-profile sexual predators being called out online .
Meanwhile , the country ’ s regime has been pushed onto the back foot on the question of sexual violence and women ’ s oppression during recent years .
It named someone in her class as the perpetrator of rape , blackmail and sexual harassment .
Assault Police now has almost 350,000 followers , and provides regular updates on high-profile sexual assault cases and advice to women about how to report their own cases .
The same mood has been visible in street demonstrations with demands about women ’ s safety in public spaces and workplaces , as well as against sexual harassment .
In December 2019 , a poor , young veiled woman appeared on a prominent satellite news show to discuss her survival of a gang rape and attempted murder in the Upper-Egyptian town of Farshut .
99 % of Egyptian women interviewed by the UN in 2013 said they had experienced sexual harassment .

When the Muslim Brotherhood was in power , media stations repeatedly ran stories of “ sexual deviance ” among the protesters .
In the last five years , the Sisi regime has stepped up a campaign of sexual repression , both against women and the LGBT community , to stoke the fires of reaction .
The waving of rainbow flags triggered a police raid of the concert , after which some people were subjected to anal probing .
The regime ’ s balancing act It is important to view two measures passed through Egyptian parliament against sexual assault and harassment in this wider context .
The first , brought in 2014 , recognised sexual harassment in law for the first time – and made it punishable with a prison sentence of up to five years .
It guarantees the anonymity of victims reporting sexual assault and harassment .
In an act of outrageous hypocrisy , Al-Azhar – the main Islamic institution of the Egyptian state – came out with a statement last summer encouraging female victims of sexual abuse to speak up .
They also echoed their previous remarks of 2018 , when they categorised sexual harassment as haram and the fault of the perpetrator : “ Women ’ s clothing – whatever it may be – is not an excuse for attacking her privacy , freedom and dignity. ” These words go against decades of television interviews and official declarations , in which imams of Al-Azhar and other organisations have gone to great lengths to justify sexual assault and harassment , blaming it on the victims based on their behaviour and clothing .
On the other hand , they can not help but at least pay lip service to progressive struggles such as the fight against sexual violence .
The whole system needs changing Although activists in the struggle against sexual violence have played a certain role in wringing some reluctant measures out of the regime , we need to be quite clear about what these concessions represent in practice .
The sexual harassment law change of 2014 has done nothing to stop street harassment .
Nor is it widely used to apprehend perpetrators of sexual violence , by police officers who side against victims ; or a judicial system founded on Sharia law .
To finish what was started ten years ago and fundamentally transform Egypt to lay the basis for a real cultural transformation , those fighting for female emancipation must appeal to the strongest force in society : the working men and women without whom society can not function / Image : Hossam el-Hamalawy , Flickr The law change to protect victims ’ identities has received praise from feminist activists and prominent survivors of sexual assault .
It is also common for male police officers to blackmail or extract bribes from women in the form of sexual favours .
Lest we forget , many of those in the gangs that carried out organised sexual assaults on female protesters in the revolutionary movement were found to be carrying state security badges .
Activists of the anti-harassment movement are taking responsibility for raising awareness of sexual violence with cases like this one .
They may say a few fine words about fighting sexual harassment , but they will never tackle this menace to women across Egypt at its root , because it is an essential part of their system .
The leaders of the workers ’ organisations have a responsibility to take up these methods in the struggle for women ’ s emancipation and against sexual violence in the labour movement .
As it stands , the movement against sexual violence has reached a dead end .

Gender differences in characteristics of physical and sexual victimization in patients with dual diagnosis : a cross-sectional study Marleen M. de Waal1,2 , Jack J. M. Dekker1,3 , Martijn J. Kikkert1 , Maaike D. Kleinhesselink1 & Anna E. Goudriaan1,2 Patients with substance use disorders and co-occurring mental health disorders are vulnerable to violent victimization .
An exploration of the characteristics of physical and sexual violence can provide valuable information to support the development of interventions for these patients .
In this cross-sectional survey study recent incidents of physical and sexual assault were examined with the Safety Monitor in 243 patients with dual diagnosis .
Chi-square tests were used to examine gender differences in the prevalence of physical and sexual victimization .
Patients with dual diagnosis were unlikely to report incidents of physical abuse and sexual assault to the police and to speak about it with caregivers .
Women with dual diagnosis are more often victims of sexual violence compared to men .
Domestic violence and sexual victimization are more prevalent in women .
In women , in most cases the perpetrator of physical and sexual assault is an acquaintance or intimate partner [ 2 , 3 ] .
Victims of sexual violence are even less likely to report the abuse [ 4,5,6 ] .
An exploration of characteristics of physical and sexual violence in patients with dual diagnosis can provide valuable information to support the development of interventions for these patients .
Recent incidents of physical and sexual assault are explored with regard to the perpetrator , the location , reporting to the police and speaking about it with others .
Data regarding physical abuse and sexual assault were used in this study .
Chi-square tests and independent t-tests were used to examine gender differences in clinical and demographic characteristics and prevalence of physical and sexual victimization .
Patients that were a victim of physical and/or sexual violence were included in the subsequent analyses .
Table 1 Demographic and clinical characteristics and violent victimization of men and women with dual diagnosis Violent victimization Of the 171 male participants 59 ( 35 % ) reported physical violence in the last 12 months and 7 ( 4 % ) reported sexual violence .
Of the 72 female participants 34 ( 47 % ) reported physical violence in the last 12 months and 21 ( 29 % ) reported sexual violence .
Participants that were a victim of physical and/or sexual violence ( N = 102 ) were included in the subsequent analyses .
One of the 7 male patients that reported sexual violence refused to answer questions about characteristics of the incident .
The remaining number of males who reported sexual assault ( N = 6 ) was too low to make a reliable comparison with the female sexual assault victims ( N = 21 ) .
Therefore we will describe the characteristics of the total group of patients with dual diagnosis that were a victim of sexual assault .
As shown in Table 3 , most victims reported sexual assault by a stranger ( 40.7 % ) followed by an ( ex ) partner ( 18.5 % ) and fellow patient ( 18.5 % ) .
Patients were most often sexually victimized at home ( 37.0 % ) followed by in another person ’ s home ( 29.6 % ) , in public ( 18.5 ) and in a care facility ( 14.8 % ) .
Table 3 Characteristics of most recent incident of sexual victimization in men and women with dual diagnosis Only 18.5 % of the victims reported the sexual assault to the police .
Further exploration per type of perpetrator We further explored the four most frequently reported perpetrators of all incidents of physical and sexual violence .
Perpetrators of sexual assault were mostly strangers ( 40.7 % ) followed by ( ex ) partners ( 18.5 % ) .
We found that sexual assault was more prevalent in women with dual diagnosis compared to men .
Too few men reported sexual assault in the 12 months prior to taking the assessment to draw reliable conclusions on the effect of gender on characteristics of sexual victimization .
Women were mostly sexually assaulted by a stranger .
Women with dual diagnosis reported physical victimization in 29.4 % of the cases and sexual victimization in 19.0 % of the cases .
Whilst these women are less inclined to speak to the police compared to women from the general population , the pattern is similar : sexual violence is less likely to be reported than physical violence [ 4,5,6 ] .
For both physical and sexual assault , the most cited reasons for not reporting the incident to the police were the belief that the police could or would not do anything to help and fear of reprisal or getting the offender in trouble .
Most victims of physical abuse and sexual assault spoke about the incident with at least one other person ( respectively 86.0 % and 74.4 % ) .
First , the experiences of physical and sexual violence were examined with a self-report questionnaire , which is subject to memory bias .
Second , we only have information about the most recent incidents of physical and sexual violence and therefore can not draw conclusions on perpetrators , locations and police reporting in patients who are victims of multiple incidents of violence .
Finally , it was impossible to draw conclusions on gender differences with regard to sexual violence , since a small number of men experienced sexual violence .
There are similarities as well as differences between men and women with dual diagnosis in characteristics of physical and sexual victimization .
Women with dual diagnosis are more often a victim of sexual violence and partner violence compared to men .
Since , to the best of our knowledge , we are the first to examine gender differences in characteristics of physical and sexual violence in patients with dual diagnosis , replication of our findings is necessary , also in other countries .

Home Men 's Health Underwear Guards Against STDs During Oral Sex Underwear Guards Against STDs During Oral Sex The first underwear meant to protect against sexually transmitted infections during oral sex was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday .
Infections such as herpes , gonorrhea and syphilis can be transmitted through oral sex , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Until now , the only FDA- authorized product for protection during oral sex was a dental dam , a thin sheet of latex polyurethane typically held in place with hands to form a barrier between the mouth and genitals , according to the Times .
“ The FDA ’ s authorization of this product gives people another option to protect against STIs during oral sex , ” Courtney Lias , director of the FDA office that led the review of the underwear , told the Times .
“ Oral sex is not totally risk-free , ” Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo , director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham , told the Times .

Today , the fields of queer and trans history are still in the process of finding ways to talk about gender and sexuality diversity among Native people in a way that is neither appropriative nor exotifying .
Here I am trying to tell the story of Ozaawindib ’ s life , not as a way to show the myriad possibilities of gender and sexuality among “ primitive ” peoples , as some white queer writers have done .
Ozaawindib ’ s story reveals important historical realities of queer , trans , and/or Two-Spirit experiences in North America , especially relating to the process of colonization and the erasure of people who did not conform to the accepted dominant standards of gender and sexuality .
In part this is due to the inevitable difficulty of labeling any historical figure ’ s gender or sexuality with a contemporary term .

Social Media Offences : About the Crime , Not the Medium Among the most egregious of social media offences is what has become known as “ revenge porn ” and there ’ s a lot more attention to this problem in the UK since former Culture Minister Maria Miller urged action on it last month .
The inquiry , while not exclusively focused on “ revenge porn , ” takes place amidst a surge in media coverage on revenge porn in the UK , spurred by MP Maria Miller ’ s statements in the House of Commons and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling ’ s promise that the government is looking into the issue .
[ raw ] [ /raw ] It is worth noting that although I will use the term because it has become popularly known , ‘ revenge porn ’ is not an adequate name since non-consensual intimate image distribution is not restricted to ex-lovers seeking revenge .
The ongoing political discussions led by Maria Miller and several civil society groups are not arguing that there are no laws to deal with revenge porn , but rather that revenge porn should be made a sexual offence .
Flexible , technology-neutral laws needed , but so are reviews and adjustments Harassment , blackmail , discrimination , death threats , and even revenge porn all pre-date the internet , but the scale of the net and its possibilities for anonymity allow these crimes to be more harmful than ever before .
Finally , offences may need to be re-categorized , as in the case of making revenge porn a sexual offence , to fully reflect the nature of the crime .

Blood flow is very important because in order to get an erection , the two types of tissues in the penis , the corpus cavernosum and the corpus spongiosum , have to become engorged with blood .
More than that , these tissues also have the ability to lock blood inside the penis for the duration of sexual intercourse .
This is important because otherwise , blood would simply flow back out of the penis and it would be impossible to maintain an erection firm enough for sex .
As you can imagine , if anything impedes the ability of blood to enter the penis , it would be very difficult to get an erection .
However , obesity is also another contributing factor and it may even cause sexual wellness problems in young men .
They may be clogged or they may simply be too weak to bring enough blood into the penis to elicit an erection .
Understanding the Treatment Process By clearing out these blood vessels , blood will automatically have a much easier time flowing into the penis .

… Random House , for example , told Minc and some reporters Monday that the person many in the press have presumed was Barry the rapist is , in fact , not the person Dunham describes .
For instance , Dunham informs us her rapist sported a flamboyant mustache , worked at the campus library , and even names the radio talk show he hosted .
Minc wants a public statement from Dunham on behalf of his client that clears him from any insinuation of rape or sexual assault .

Peter Frederiksen committed crimes that strike almost everyone as utterly unthinkable , especially considering the many other sexual assaults and violations of female bodily autonomy coming to light like we have today .
Frederiksen was also quite public about his views on female genital mutilation , even stating in an interview with Danish journalists that he was a pseudo-surgeon and had actually mutilated the genitals of women before .
Penis. ” [ 2 ] That man was named Jorn Ege , and he specialized specifically in penis enlargement surgery , hence the name .
Anna alleged that Frederiksen drugged her by lacing her champagne , knocking her out with a heavy sedative , and then proceeded to forcibly cut off her genitals .
[ 3 ] When she awoke , the external parts of her vagina had been forcibly removed with surgical equipment against her will .
7 Serial Sexual Assault Photo credit : PH It should be noted here that , as far as we know , Peter Frederiksen never killed anyone , but he did commit a morally repugnant series of sexual assaults , preying upon women as he so chose , including his own wife .
In his home , police found child pornography , surgical equipment , anesthesia , and illegal firearms .
Yeah , well , those were his own records—Peter Frederiksen kept detailed accounts of each and every person whose genitals he ’ d cut off , neatly and in his own handwriting .
He did , however , have one entry titled “ Pedophile Pig , ” where he discussed his rape and abuse of a girl who was only nine years old when Frederiksen went to trial for his crimes .
6 Forced Removal The fact remains that Peter Frederiksen drugged his wife and rendered her unconscious before forcibly removing her genitals .
Police had a detailed list of his sexual crimes in the form of his diary , including mentions of pedophilic practices as well as sedating other women before removing their genitalia against their wishes .
His charges included pedophilia , 32 counts of possession of child pornography , manufacturing and distributing child pornography , the illegal removal of human tissue , causing grievous bodily harm , and even conspiracy to commit murder .
[ 8 ] And what about all the charges of pedophilia and child pornography ?
Frederiksen stated that he had no interest in child pornography , neither the possession of it nor the manufacturing and distribution of it , and was using it for “ research , ” noting that his efforts were almost complete .
The judge residing over the case decided to drop two charges of rape pertaining to Anna , which would have been mighty hard to prove without the victim to give testimony .
However , it was the video interview which Peter Frederiksen had done with the Danish journalists which really sealed the deal , as he , in his own words , on video , described how he drugged and rendered women unconscious to subsequently remove their genitals .
Investigators weren ’ t initially sure how many women the genitalia in the freezer belonged to in total , with first estimates pegging the number at seven women .

Some people who are not currently married nonetheless cohabit , or live together with someone of the opposite sex in a romantic relationship .
When spouses from the same marriage are interviewed , they disagree on such things as how often they should have sex , how often they actually do have sex , and who does various household tasks .
Contemporary research generally finds that marriage does benefit both sexes : married people , women and men alike , are generally happier than unmarried people ( whether never married , divorced , or widowed ) , score better on other measures of psychological well-being , are physically healthier , have better sex lives , and have lower death rates ( Williams , 2003 ; Waite , Luo , & Lewin , 2009 ) .
As a review of this body of research concluded , “ Because every relevant study to date shows that parental sexual orientation per se has no measurable effect on the quality of parent-child relationships or on children ’ s mental health or social adjustment , there is no evidentiary basis for considering parental sexual orientation in decisions about children ’ s ‘ best interest ’ ” ( Stacey & Biblarz , 2001 , p. 176 ) .

sexual misconduct treatment in NYC Professional Sexual Misconduct Counseling I have helped many clients who engaged in Professional Sexual Misconduct change the thinking , lifestyle choices , and other dynamic and long term factors that contributed to their engaging in this destructive behavior .
Schedule a Session Professional Sexual Misconduct A person in a position of professional authority who engages in sexual contact with a subordinate or client is committing Professional Sexual Misconduct .
Any similar fiduciary and/or imbalance of power situation that becomes sexual .
The offending professional may think and act in a style that is exclusively motivated by sexuality , with no emotional attachment to their victim , or they may go in the other direction and believe they ’ ve “ fallen in love ” with their client and have much loftier goals for the “ relationship ” .
The media portrayal of Professional Sexual Misconduct would lead one to believe that sexual contact with a subordinate or client would lead to a life of “ happy ever after , ” when in reality the professional will have a very different outcome .
The victim may also sue the professional , regardless of if one or both parties are motivated to engage in this sexual activity .
In any clinical relationship , having sexual contact with the client even long after the professional contact has ended remains unethical for the professional , because of the client ’ s transference has not ended , and it is assumed that client ’ s transference to that professional never ends .
Ongoing or newly developing mental health issues , ( such as untreated psychiatric illness , mood disorder , personality disorder , active substance abuse , paraphilic urges , or a return to sexual addiction ) , can all leave the professional in a position to be more likely to break boundaries .

I once saw a son call his father one ( he was n't serious ) , and even my sister once got so angry at me she sputtered , `` You pussy ! ''
( By the way , a pedophile likes children and a pederast likes teenage boys . )
The `` alpha male '' is the head of a pack , a `` family unit '' and he mates with the alpha female , a female '' that reproduces his offspring , is not on chemical birth control , does not have an I.U.D. , has n't had her vagina available to dozens of other male wolves , knows and understands her role in the pack hierarchy , is n't impressed with herself , does n't take `` selfies '' and never watched `` Eat , Pray , Love . ''
What you consider `` Alpha '' , Mr. other `` anonymous '' , are unstable frauds who have intercourse with unstable sluts , both groups bringing nothing to the table of civilization except destruction .
Or what you 'd call a pussy and Roissy a beta .
But also , like in '50s America , civilization means betas have sex too .
( Now they marry the state : they take the betas ' money but do n't give them sex . )
Now , with the sexual revolution and the rest of the Sixties ' aftermath , you have a return to the wild , to savagery , like Roissy describes .
The girls in their prime share alphas , the only men having sex , even though it 's un-reproductive , and nice guys , like maybe the one in the picture , do n't get any .
I had some guy who makes coffee at a coffee house ( he was a flamer ) get really ignorant and I almost called him a faggot .
And trust me , never fuck with an elephant .
Your sex may also affect how they respond .
However , please note that you or your parent ’ s sex does not necessarily determine whether they have or don ’ t have certain traits .
In the end , regardless of your sex , narcissistic parents and parental figures will try to violate your boundaries and manipulate you in whatever way they can , whether it ’ s through guilt-tripping , stonewalling , gaslighting , threats , or straight-up demands .

By the time the U.S. Supreme Court weighed in , 29 states ( including Wisconsin ) had changed their state constitutions to prohibit government recognition of same sex marriages .

I got a flu shot ONCE ... and it injured me ... and I am still dealing with that shit all these years later .
`` If I want to walk around nude you do n't have the right ... '' '' If I want to drive without a license you do n't have the right to stop me ... '' It 's a ridiculous statement when applied to things that do n't cause serious injury .
You would be willing to take one for the team and say `` Well , yeah ... it sucks that my kid died , but hey , at least that transplant patient is A-OK '' .
One should think twice or even three times when dealing with big pharma or weird people mixing shit together in laboratories .
At the end of the day I think letting someone inject shit into you might be worst than the flu .

Two of the routes of hepatitis C transmission in Canada are sharing needles/syringes and other drug use equipment , and high-risk sexual practices among HIV-positive men who have sex with men ( MSM ) .
Sexual transmission is likely the predominant route of hepatitis C acquisition among MSM , especially among HIV-positive MSM.16 Hepatitis C viral loads are higher in semen , blood and rectal fluid in MSM with HIV co-infection,16 which may increase the likelihood that hepatitis C is transmitted sexually.16 Some activities can facilitate the sexual transmission of hepatitis C. Examples include condomless anal sex ; enema use prior to receptive anal sex ; rectal trauma with bleeding ; fisting ; and group sex.5,6,16,19 Recreational drug use , in the context of sexual networks , commonly referred to as “ chemsex ” or Party and Play ( PnP ) , is also thought to facilitate hepatitis C transmission among some MSM.5,6 “ Chemsex ” refers to the use of recreational drugs ( injecting and non-injecting drug use before , during and after sex ) to enhance sexual experience and to facilitate extended sexual sessions , often with multiple sexual partners .
This puts men at high risk of hepatitis C infection and other sexually transmitted infections.5,6,8,19,20,21,22 While similar risk behaviours are observed in HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM , hepatitis C incidence is significantly higher among HIV-positive MSM.5,16,17 Hepatitis C prevalence among HIV-negative MSM who don ’ t inject drugs is comparable to the general population.16 The reported incidence rates of re-infection among HIV-positive MSM following cure5,11 are higher than in people who inject drugs.16 The cumulative risk of re-infection calculated from studies of MSM is 12.8 per 100 person years,16 compared to 2.4 per 100 person years for people who inject drugs.3 In the largest cohort of HIV-positive MSM in Western Europe , it was estimated that almost one-quarter ( 24.6 % ) of enrolled patients were re-infected within five years of cure .
Many of these studies have underscored the importance of sexual networks among MSM , and that hepatitis C re-infection patterns are primarily occurring within existing sexual networks.5,6,8,16,19 “ Chemsex ” is now largely accepted as facilitating hepatitis C transmission within certain sexual networks , driving both primary and secondary re-infections.5,16,19,21 In Canada we have generally seen lower rates of hepatitis C infection among MSM ( both HIV positive and negative ) than in Europe ; 7 however , the implications for the Canadian context are important and relevant to consider .
Acknowledgement of this reality without discrimination and further stigma associated with high-risk drug use and sexual practices is important .
Service providers will undoubtedly see hepatitis C re-infection among some of their clients who continue to engage in high-risk sexual and drug use behaviours after successful treatment .
Clients should be offered accessible and culturally appropriate information , education and counselling about the risks of transmission , infection and re-infection associated with drug use and sexual practices .
Treatment should occur in concert with sexual health and harm reduction counselling from healthcare providers and peers .
For all clients with ongoing risk behaviours after treatment , it is important to expand testing opportunities to identify those in the early stages of re-infection at the earliest opportunity so they can be re-engaged in care.2,25 Testing and treatment of injecting and sexual partners and networks may also play a role in reducing re-infection rates by reducing the overall prevalence of hepatitis C in the community .

I think they 're still precious and we had four of them and we loved our little boys and I photographed him and I actually did kids for a while I loved photographing kids , but they 're hard if it does n't fit you like a glove , do n't touch it do n't get near it because you 're not going to be happy and so , um , find something that you love find something that you say I 'm gon na get up at five in the morning to go out and photograph whatever it is that fits you like a glove picked that because you 've got to stick with it to brand it three to five years before it takes root and it 'll have a seventeen year life span that 's a long time photographing one subject there was I do n't know this photographer I hate this because I do this all the time but I was in like pottery barn or whatever and there was just you know they have a display and there was this beautiful sailboat picture gorgeous shot and I went and I found this guy and I looked him up and he 's just all he does sailboats I wish I knew his name I apologize you 'll probably find him if you type in sailboat fine art stuff beautiful stuff it 's been a lifetime doing it photographing that he loves you like certain uh snow snowboarding seen snow sports whatever go after if you do n't like it I hate being cold oh , I just did a shoot we had b up and tell you right we amy and I both got caught on top of the mountain and a blizzard could n't see I could n't see the end of my skis and we 're trying to get down way down my miserable right that 's hard I do n't like that put me the desert I 'm fine so butt pic would fit you like a glove and then you could repeat it over and over and over again because remember how many hours you spend if you do if you do thirty to fifty self assignments a year and you got to retouch all those how many hours a week are you gon na be working on that image or that that brand what they 'll pick something does n't make sense so pick something that you love now here 's the next thing beat that mitch into the ground beat in the ground do n't let anyone come along say are n't you done with that yet are n't gon na move on no you beat in the ground so actually I see that my slides here I ended up jumping ahead on my own three to five years thing but here we goes so let 's go back to this so now that we 've covered it um three to five years how do I know this ?
Something could 've done ten years ago I asked my question if I could have done it ten years ago chances are today would be boring I want to produce a picture today that looks amazing today it 's today 's current techniques , tools everything does n't mean that you ca n't take in fact I 'm gon na try to do across light scenario today I 'd across like twenty five years but I 'm kind of looking at looking for bringing back my cross light look beautiful light sought cross light look but now I 'm doing with digital and I 'm also doing it in photo shop and um you know , cleaning some things up and adding deck textures in the background so but yes , um I do n't wan na have been created image that I could have done ten years ago even though even might have a host of my kids love it they 'll go down this stuff some of your best up like do n't say that I want you to say that my current stuff but it is what it wass back then it was fun stuff , but I moved on right do n't listen to the lazy whining naysayers everywhere you go we talked aboutthe weiners , but everywhere you go people want to pull you down here 's the crazy thing about photographers and I hate to say this because I 'm in the field of the much of a target reason rebels elbows with the mall time and maybe not as much today as it was in the older days but in the I say the older days back when I was going labs and we 'd meet photographers on a regular basis but photographers I did not want you to succeed because your competition we 'll talk all about this later so photographers tended to try toe suck the life out of you by saying , oh , industry sucks you know , my client 's air , you know , demanding more out of me in pain less you know , the stuff that sucks the life out here is not an encouraging exhortation of uh life it was like sucking the life out of you and so the tigris did n't do that they do n't want you to succeed now I think that 's changed a little bit I think part of it is because as we have now the internet and as we 're learning everyone 's learning from everybody and we tend to realise I think more today than it before that if I give I get more in return right ?

No sooner was he turned off , than , the rope slipping , he dropped to the ground ; but , being immediately tied up again , he said aloud , ' I adhere to my former confession , and die an innocent man . '
Let me give you just three examples : the teaching of blood atonement for murder ( the Church has come out with an official statement that this is not a doctrine of the LDS church ; the teaching that Christ was married ( the Church says we don ’ t know if Christ was married –we are not saying he is not , but we are not saying he was — that is not a doctrine of the Church ; and third , the teaching that Heavenly Father had sexual relations with Mary ( again , the Church has announced that this is not Church doctrine .
There is simply no basis for assuming a celestial sex ratio highly skewed in favor of women .
How could God be no respecter of persons and create a system where one spirit , because it is male has a much worst chance , a much poorer chance of reaching the celestial kingdom than the other sex ?
Some of you may know that I have authored books on the abnormal sex ratios of Asia – that they are branch hypotheses .
The sex ratio evens out at age five , because male babies suffer from disproportionately higher infant mortality than female babies , and we assume that all of those are saved in the celestial kingdom .
Do you know what the conception sex ratio is ?
Then there are still others , who say , look , human male sexual anatomy obviously holds that men are designed to be polygamous .
And since male sexual anatomy is an image of our Heavenly Father then , yeah , bingo .

The characteristic triad of rhabdomyolysis includes weakness , myalgias , and red to brown urine ( due to myoglobinuria ) accompanied by an elevated serum concentration of creatine kinase.1,2 In exertional rhabdomyolysis , damage to skeletal muscle is generally caused by high-intensity , protracted , or repetitive physical activity , usually after engaging in unaccustomed strenuous exercise ( especially with eccentric and/or muscle-lengthening contractions ) .3 Even athletes who are used to intense training and who are being carefully monitored are at risk of this condition,4 especially if new overexertion-inducing exercises are being introduced.5 Illness severity ranges from elevated serum muscle enzyme levels without clinical symptoms to life-threatening disease associated with extreme enzyme elevations , electrolyte imbalances , and kidney failure.1–3,6 Risk factors for exertional rhabdomyolysis include younger age , male sex , a lower level of physical fitness , a prior heat illness , a lower level of education , and exertion during the warmer months of the year.1,3,7–10 Acute kidney injury , due to an excessive concentration of free myoglobin in the urine accompanied by volume depletion , renal tubular obstruction , and renal ischemia , represents a serious complication of rhabdomyolysis.6,11 Severly affected patients can also develop compartment syndrome , fever , dysrhythmias , metabolic acidosis , and altered mental status .

But since the game will be shorter , a number of things will be changed/removed for the final version , most of the things such as anal will likely be removed from the corruption check , and the dialog for backing the chapel .
As of alpha 0.8 , It 's only possible to masturbate/have sex ( not counting sex with elly ) once I think , sorry if the corruption stat is a bit confusing right now , most of the corruption stats will be removed for the final version , so corruption stats will probably only play a very minor role in-game .

In the 2018 film Love , Simon , the titular Simon ’ s ( Nick Robinson ) arc is centered around him coming to terms with his sexuality .
It also creates a toxic expectation and pressure for queer characters to come out , and that the people around them have a right to every detail of their sexuality .
When Simon ’ s sexuality is publicized in a manner outside of his consent and control , many of his friends , such as his best friend Leah ( Katherine Langford ) , feel betrayed—as though they were owed the revelation of his sexuality in the first place .

However , Adam ’ s general inexperience with this new facet of his sexuality , as well as his less overt style of expressing his queerness is treated as something wholly negative .
Queer characters are not only expected to have everything about their sexuality figured out , but are also expected to constantly express their sexuality in an explicit way or run the risk of being disregarded as “ not queer enough. ” The pressure to come out and meet a certain standard of queerness in the media also disregards the nuances of race and culture that affect how queerness is experienced .
In many cases , race completely shifts how sexuality and gender are experienced , such as the unique relationship black femmes have with femininity .

`` Cheating '' is n't only about one person having sex with someone other than the one person they agreed to be monogamous with .

“ For the past 25 years , Safe Zone-type programs on college campuses have always been about supportive allies hanging a sign to show they were safe to come out to as a sexual or gender minority , while encouraging conversation with others that have questions about LGBTQIA+ people , ” said Kerry Poynter , director of the UIS Office of Gender and Sexuality Student Services .
A confidential dialogue will be facilitated that allows members to share their own experiences and attempts to advocate and/or intervene as allies to gender and sexual minorities .

The porousness of the boundary emerges here in various kinds of “ possession ” —all the way from a full taking over of the person , as with a medium , to various kinds of domination by or partial fusion with a spirit or God .

I strive constantly to remember not to bitch about my bounty of blessings .
They told me I could push whenever I felt the need , and I did , there on the bed , on all fours , covered for a while with those now-cold warmed blankets , then with my bare ass shining out for all to see .
I remember looking down and seeing the bloody mucus hanging - oh my goodness , there were four women staring at my ass as I slowly dripped yuck .
The squatting was n't working , and I was becoming less and less concerned about my naked ass in front of these women , and more and more concerned with the fact that Geneva had n't arrived after a couple of good pushes .
Despite everything else these people had seen of me in the few hours we 'd been acquainted , I was concerned enough about my dignity that I did not want them to see poop come out of my butt .
The third time , though , the phrase `` fuck it '' when through my mind , and I pushed and did n't pull back , I followed through .
I pushed again , but I could feel myself stretching , at the top of my vagina , and I was so afraid I was going to tear , so again , I held back at the last second .
With the next wave , I pushed with everything I had , and when I felt myself start to tear , I again thought `` fuck it '' , and pushed harder - And she was here .
I piped up , `` I do n't give a shit ! ''
We were getting along swimmingly , and then I think she gave my nipples the thrush .
Suddenly my right nipple felt like it was being pierced when she ate - I 've cried a lot in the last few days .
And some nights nothing will console her but a nipple , and his do n't fit the bill - and I get jealous as hell watching him over on the couch , able to get up and move around all nimbly pimbly whenever he likes .

Things were so quiet in that area of my life that , I ’ m pretty sure my grandmother might have questioned if I was attracted to the opposite sex at all , bless her .
In this household we date ! ” She knew that that kind of environment , when things aren ’ t clearly defined , and people are not exactly sure where they stand , created a huge gap for VERY messed up , unhealthy friendships with the opposite sex .
The truth is , I was so desperately searching for approval of the opposite sex ( due to past hurts not dealt with ) that I didn ’ t have the maturity or self-esteem to give a voice to my feelings or to confront the unhealthy friendships that stemmed from that environment .
There was one time I even punched him in the throat , and he just held my arms and he was like Erik No don ’ t do it , you know , instead of kicking my butt .

A study of the long-term impact of child abuse and neglect found that neglect was one of the most severe types of maltreatment when compared to emotional , sexual and physical abuse .
The study found children who experienced emotional abuse were also worse off than sexually or physically abused children .
The study , led by UQ medical school and PhD graduate Dr Lane Strathearn , anonymously linked the data with state government reports of child abuse and neglect to examine how child maltreatment was associated with a broad range of outcomes over two decades , including cognitive , educational , psychological , sexual and physical health , and addiction .
Data showed that sexual and physical abuse led to fewer negative outcomes overall .
“ Sexual abuse victims experienced early sexual activity , teen pregnancy , depressive symptoms , and post-traumatic stress disorder , but to a lesser severity than neglected children , ” he said .

Last December , CPS passed a new sexual education policy .
The caregiver support that Healing to Action is advocating for recognizes that students learn first from their parents or guardians about sex ed .
Auri Aguilar and Gladys de la Torre , survivor leaders with Healing to Action , spoke at the rally about their experiences with sex ed as young women and why they set out to change the narrative for their children .
“ When I was young , I promised myself what happened to me wasn ’ t going to happen to anyone else. ” Aguilar also talked about generational harm caused by gender-based violence that she noticed in her life and how advocating for the umbrella of issues that fall under sex ed has provided a sense of healing for her .
When parents know more about sex ed they can establish deeper connections with their kids and reduce gender-based violence .
Even if the curriculum is more inclusive and reduces shame , that doesn ’ t mean that parents or teachers are fully equipped for conversations about sex ed .
After she immigrated , de la Torre got more involved with her two children ’ s studies , including sex ed .
She explained , In the US , I learned how important it is to have comprehensive sex ed because it is important for the emotional health of children .
In my community we really can not talk about sex ed because it is taboo .
De la Torre speaks her Native Kichwa language , and when she immigrated to Chicago , she learned that resources aren ’ t spread so evenly when it comes to sex ed and language barriers .

Sexpectations , a collective of Black and brown femmes in Chicago , works to bring an inclusive lens to sex ed for Chicago youth .
They recognize not every young person in Chicago goes to school , and not all Chicago students attend CPS , so making sure sex ed is accessible and normalized in community areas is key to their work .
We are currently building curriculum through an antiracist , decolonized , abolitionist lens to talk about sex and identity , ” Karbassi said .
“ In a dream world , CPS would allow us to come in and teach CPS students , and all CPS schools would have a sexual health educator young folks could trust to go to .
Healing to Action requested that at least one million dollars be allocated toward implanting sexual education support for educators and caregivers , but transparency has led to this decision being under wraps .

Home National News University of Notre Dame forum tackles issue of clergy sex abuse University of Notre Dame forum tackles issue of clergy sex abuse Kathleen McChesney , former FBI executive assistant director who investigated abuse victim allegations , speaks during a panel discussion titled `` The Church Crisis : Where Are We Now ? ''
— The annual University of Notre Dame forum on topics of importance began its 2019-20 season with the difficult issue of clergy sex abuse in a Sept. 25 keynote panel titled “ The Church Crisis : Where Are We Now ? ” The four panelists — Baltimore Archbishop William E. Lori , law enforcement consultant Kathleen McChesney , abuse survivor Juan Carlos Cruz and journalist Peter Steinfels — brought a wide spectrum of experience with the topic .
Steinfels , a journalist and educator , has reported on the sex abuse crisis for 30 years .

The sex abuse scandal will always remain one in the long list of betrayals of Jesus Christ over the centuries , Steinfels said .

Kanye West Talk About Porn The research about the public health harms of pornography is clear , and now celebrity after public figure after icon — the latest being Kanye West–are increasingly willing to be vocal about the harms of pornography that they ’ ve personally witnessed and experienced .
“ Playboy was my gateway into full-blown pornography addition , ” Kanye West told Zane Lowe in an extensive interview for Apple Music ’ s Beats 1 , “ My dad had a Playboy left out ( when I was five ) and it ’ s affected almost every choice I made for the rest of my life–from age five to now having to kick the habit .
And I stand up and say , you know , it ’ s not okay. ” Elsewhere in the interview , Kanye also commented on the connection between strip clubs and sex trafficking , the way instant access to hardcore pornography has changed the way we view sexual material , and compared the similarities between his addiction to pain killers and his addiction to porn .
The 42 year old performer hasn ’ t been shy about discussing pornography in the past , but the candid admission of addiction during his lengthy Beats 1 interview was a stark departure from his past commentary .
As recently as August of 2018 , West confessed to Jimmy Kimmel that having daughters hadn ’ t affected his view of the opposite sex with a blunt “ Nah , I still look at Pornhub ” — an admission that netted him a free lifetime premium membership from the prominent pornography website .
Kanye ’ s subsequent rejection of pornography stands in powerful opposition to the desperate attempts of the porn industry to position itself as a “ respectable ” entity .
Kanye West ’ s 180-degree pivot on pornography appears to highlight a remarkable transition in perspective and his comments on how the addiction impacted him are reflected in the research related to porn , addiction , and the harms of pornography .
Over 15 states have now declared porn to be a public health crisis and still more are in the process of considering similar measures .
In our rundown of the research and data that explains and confirms the public harms of pornography , there are several buckets that stand out as important indicators of porn ’ s widespread destruction : Pornography is pervasive Pornography negatively impacts sexual violence Pornography has detrimental impacts on the brain Pornography is associated with increases in sexually transmitted diseases Pornography has negative physical , relational , and psychological impacts on males and females There is so much information backing up the harmful effects of pornography on individuals and society that we had to dedicate an entire section of our website to covering it , says the National Counsel on Sex Exploitation ( NCOSE ) NCOSE went on to say , “ We ’ re glad to see more people speaking out about how dangerous and problematic porn and the pornography industry is and we hope you will learn more and become a part of the movement to end sexual exploitation in all of its forms .

Rage Doesn ’ t Exist in a Vacuum , or : Understanding the Complex Continuum of Internet Butt-Hurt * / Assumptions / March 7 , 2014 March 7 , 2014 I once stood at a bus stop in Durban while two young , drunk men murmured sexually explicit threats and promises to a young woman standing next to me .
They were just talking about all the sexual things they wanted to do to her .
But after a few minutes , when they didn ’ t seem to tire of their threats , but instead kept at it , I finally lost my shit .
It was a fantastic losing-of-the-shit , because I ’ d spent the last six months hurrying back to my flat before dark , being told by every well-meaning person I knew that there were evil men waiting to rape , mutilate and murder me – maybe not even in that order !
To an outsider seeing my screaming meltdown at these two men , in which I raved and shouted and told them how they were utter assholes for harassing us , and they should fuck off , and who the fuck did they think they were , this might have seemed like the raving of some unhinged person .
It was a rage at the entire situation , at being expected to shut the fuck up and go inside all the time because I was a young woman .
I was afraid to say something , because I was afraid they ’ d knife me or something. ” When the internet loses its shit over what , to many , looks like a single , insignificant incident unrelated to anything else , it ’ s easy to say they ’ re fucking nuts .
Especially when you ’ re in a place where it ’ s never your butt getting hurt .
Same shit , different pocket ) .
We got all sorts of push back on this , about how we should be more “ civil ” and “ settle down. ” We got told we were “ over-reacting. ” We were being “ pushy bitches ” and “ making something out of nothing. ” But the truth was that unless we made a big fucking stink , people went back to the status quo .
“ Settle the fuck down , you got your way , ” also doesn ’ t work after a fight is over , because though dudes may go “ Yeah , we get it , women blog ” unless you ’ re on it like a fucking trainwreck , you ’ ll have the conversation again six months later .
If I shut the fuck up , then all the people you quote , all the people who write the post-narrative , the big pieces that folks look back on to create the history and narrative of an event , even a successful one , will be made by the powerful , influencial people who believe their hurt feelings at being called out as problematic somehow outweigh the concerns of an entire community of folks with no media pull and no platform whose voices have been marginalized their whole lives , and are now being reduced to a crazy , screaming , angry mob acting up out of nowhere , instead of a passionate community of folks reacting to an event they see as existing on a problematic continuum .
Like Nelson Mandela didn ’ t blow shit up .
Like MLK would tell us all to shut the fuck up , and women never chained themselves to the fences in city squares , stormed political buildings or committed acts of arson and violence in an effort to achieve suffrage .
My specialization is in the history of revolutionary movements , and let me tell you , folks – being nice and holding hands didn ’ t get shit done .
I wish a nice circle jerk got shit done as much as the next person , but if it were so , history would look much , much different .
It ’ s full of angry people saying angry things , because they ’ ve been disrespected and forgotten again and again and again and again , and they ’ re tired of being fucking nice because it makes you uncomfortable if they act in any way that is not deferential or subservient to you and your worldview .
Real fucking problems and issues that exist on a continuum of shame , disrespect , and forced subservience they ’ ve had to deal with their whole lives .
Because that ’ s a heavy fucking responsibility , and it ’ s easier to pretend you ’ re still mewling Peter Parker , complaining about how no girl will fuck you .
Or we can get the fuck up and fight for the people who are continually shit on , and act like a fucking hero would act .

Transmission of Zika Virus Through Sexual Contact with Travelers to Areas of Ongoing Transmission — Continental United States , 2016 During February 6–22 , 2016 , two confirmed and four probable cases of Zika virus sexual transmission were reported to CDC by health officials from multiple states .
Trends in Attitudes About Marriage , Childbearing , and Sexual Behavior : United States , 2002 , 2006–2010 , and 2011–2013 From 2002 to 2011–2013 , there was an increase in the percentages of men and women who agreed with premarital cohabitation , nonmarital childbearing , the right for gay and lesbian adults to adopt children , same-sex sexual relations , and premarital sex for those aged 18 .
There is a systematic , world-wide collusion with Israel 's oppression and domination .
Also , the public needs to become more concerned about the well-being of those attacked because of their sexual orientation instead of just those attacked based on race , religion , or other forms of discrimination .
“ Hate-crime legislation increases a criminal ’ s sentence if it can be proven that the crime of which they were found guilty was motivated by hatred of the victim because of their race , religion , sex , or some other factor .
“ Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia have established some sort of mechanism to respond to and/or record information about hate crimes related to sexual orientation .
Of these only the states of California , Minnesota , Vermont , and the District of Columbia also identify transgendered people as a protected group for purpose of hate crime laws. ” ( Meide , 2000 ) Therefore , over half the states , including North Carolina , do not have laws against hate crimes specific to sexual orientation .
“ Although the federal Hate Crimes Statistics Act requires the United States Justice Department to collect and repot on information about hate violence related to sexual orientation , recording and reporting of information by all local police is not required. ” ( Meide , 2000 ) The government , especially local government and police , seem very lax about the issue of hate crimes because of sexual orientation .
However , I do believe that laws against hate crimes based on sexual orientation are not as favored as laws for other forms of hate crimes .
“ It is important to note that both anti-discrimination and hate crimes laws do not only protect members of , for example , ethnic , religious , or sexual minorities .
These laws protect all people from hatred and unfair treatment based upon , for example , a person ’ s race , religion , and sexual orientation. ” ( Meide , 2000 ) Several different types of people benefit from this public policy .
When it comes to hate crimes based on sexual orientation , the public does not care very much .
His current work focuses on a philosophical shift , from being a “ preference utilitarian ” to being a “ hedonistic utilitarian. ” Loosely , his interpretation of hedonism in this context is “ happiness. ” His talk ranged widely , from a discussion of strength of orgasm , to the movie “ The Matrix , ” to Daniel Kahneman .
The social shit just happens because it happens .
When we kvell about the game during dinner or during post-game talks , sometimes we ’ ll talk about it but more often than not we ’ re talking about funny moments ( “ Drink O ’ Declan ’ s ! “ ) and crazy shit that happens ( “ I can ’ t believe Judd had Aaron ’ s character gut-shot in the first game ; that ’ ll teach him not to play a bad-ass elf. ” ) .
“ But Judd , what meaning does it really have ? ” This shit we ’ re making up together ( at the table , I mean ) doesn ’ t mean anything ?

It is the story of a woman who got shipwrecked on the Blazing World where she is made an Empress and she utilizes all her authority and power to make sure that it is free of war , unfair sexual discrimination , and religious division .
It evokes a mood quite independent of the scene in the movie ; indeed , it gives your imagination the freedom to dream of sexy and sophisticated pictures .
We do not need the government to teach sex education in kindergarten , argue about what to feed kids for breakfast , lunch , and supper , and how to fill them with radical ideas .

From the Darwinian lens , men overperceive their sexual attractiveness because it allows them to approach women much more attractive than they are .
The “ Madonna Whore ” Misogynist Though Freud is known for his sexist theories ( i.e. , penis envy ) , he did nail down some bizarro sexual issues exemplified by an unfortunate segment of the straight male population .
According to an article by The Latch , when Freud was practicing psychiatry in the early 20th Century , he noticed a psychological dichotomy in some of his male patients that he dubbed the ‘ Madonna-Whore complex. ’ Guys with this complex view women as either virginal , good girls worthy of love and respect , or prostitutes to be defiled with sex , never both .
Freud said of this complex , “ Where such men love , they have no desire and where they desire , they can not love. ” Men with a Madonna-Whore Complex fail to see women as complex sexual beings capable of being both motherly and sexual simultaneously .
Ingrained within these misogynists are age-old perceptions of sex originating from monotheistic religions , which initially were designed to keep men from raping every woman , child and goat in the village .

The assailant escaped ; however the following day , Victoria drove the same route , though faster and with a greater escort , in a deliberate attempt to provoke Francis to take a second aim and catch him in the act .
As Victoria 's monarchy became more symbolic than political , it placed a strong emphasis on morality and family values , in contrast to the sexual , financial and personal scandals that had been associated with previous members of the House of Hanover and which had discredited the monarchy .

The conflict between powerful sexual impulses and moral , ethical or religious value systems may create disturbing personality problems that can be involved in the genesis of multiple personality .
On the other hand , there may be episodes when powerful sexual drives result in actions that are inconsistent with these value systems .
The result is an intermittent expression of a “ sexual ” personality that is in stark contrast to the “ normal ” personality .
Such problems can be related to unresolved conflicts involving sexual or aggressive impulses .
By producing proteins that are usually reserved for the testicles , semen and placenta , the cancer pulls off a one-of-a-kind con by posing as an outlandish reproductive tissue , deceiving the immune machinery into protection rather than attack .
Distinguished Professorship in Brain Tumor Research Research Professor of Neurosurgery Houston Methodist Studies show that gonadal hormones or sex steroids and glioblastoma are closely related .
The cancer also synthesizes sex steroids , which it uses to promote its malignancy .
And how do sex steroids facilitate this process ?
As a starting point , the researchers classified glioblastoma as estrogenic , androgenic or asteroidogenic ( lacking a significant hormonal signature ) based on the expression of genes needed for the synthesis of sex steroids .
When boys reach puberty , they produce semen , whose contents are foreign to the immune system .
CD4+ T cells at the mucosal lining in the cervix possessing receptors for seminal epitopes are told by the immune system to convert into uterocervical RORC Tregs and to henceforth recognize the contents of semen as privileged , thwarting an inflammatory immune response .
“ A woman , for instance , has Tregs for proteins in her partner ’ s semen .
Sharpe noted that the glioblastoma ’ s close dependence on sex steroids could offer the opportunity to repurpose hormone therapy-based drugs that are already used in clinics to treat breast and castration-resistant prostate cancer .

Partly because these people are such utter cocks that comment is generally otiose .
Nevertheless , I feel obliged to draw your attention to a piece in this week ’ s Specator where Mr Liddle appears not just to excuse the sexual exploitation of pupils by teachers , but to confess ( or boast ) that had he become a teacher…well , read an excerpt for yourself : “ I never found out [ what sort of teacher I ’ d be ] because the one thing stopping me from being a teacher was that I could not remotely conceive of not trying to shag the kids .
Frowned upon , although not much more , I ought to say — certainly not the deranged howling that is kicked up these days , the fury and the righteous anger. ” NB : The Sexual Offences Act , 2003 makes it a criminal offence for a teacher to have any form of sexual contact with any pupil at their school who is below the age of 18 , even if the pupil is above the legal age of consent .
The motion states that Galloway ‘ referred to a man inserting his penis into a sleeping woman as , “ bad sexual etiquette ’ and that Tony Benn said of the Assange case , “ the charges are that it was a non-consensual relationship .
Well that ’ s very different from rape ” . ’ Tony Benn has since , at the request of Goldsmith Students Union , of which he is the honoury president , retracted his remarks , apologised and restated his life-long commitment to women ’ s liberation .
It is wrong to state that non-consensual sex is not rape , and it was wrong to try to defend Assange from extradition by dismissing the claims of the women involved .
Backward ideas about rape are profoundly upsetting and damaging to the fight against women ’ s oppression .
While the motion makes brief reference to Roger Helmer ( UKIP MEP ) and Andrew Brons ( an MEP for the fascist BNP and a former leader of the fascist National Front ) , why are the members of the Coalition government who are overseeing massive cuts to rape crisis and domestic violence services not in this motion ?
And why is the NUS , which has let its members down so badly over the fight against fees and cuts , not organising against the closure of rape crisis centres ?
Now there are a zillion shemale sites on the web .
And now , in memoriam , let me name what we will always remember about Doris Waugh Betts : Her love of literature and her feisty determination to make her own stories not merely interesting , but intriguing , tackling the toughest of subjects—betrayal , sexual abuse , the death of a beloved child—and challenging readers to search the depths of her words and of their own experience .
Yes , she grieved , of course she grieved , but she faced loss and death with the same spunk she had shown in breaking literary and educational barriers during her long and fruitful life .
The Russian elite could never get its shit together , to put it mildly , and when it did like in the Decembrist Revolt , it turned to utter disaster because of bad planning , hesitance , and cowardliness .
I always knew it Snakes have a clitoris : scientists overcome ‘ a massive taboo around female genitalia ’ Female snakes have clitorises , scientists have detailed for the first time in a study of the animal ’ s sex organs .
The scientists say previous research had mistaken the organs as scent glands or underdeveloped versions of penises , in a study that criticised the comparatively limited research into female sex organs .
‘ They ’ ll swim , they ’ ll climb trees ’ : experts hissue warning over snakes on the flood plains “ Female genitalia are conspicuously overlooked in comparison to their male counterparts , limiting our understanding of sexual reproduction across vertebrate lineages , ” the study ’ s authors wrote .
A French hospital was partially evacuated Saturday after a senior citizen arrived with a World War I artillery shell lodged in his rectum .
Stunned doctors subsequently began the process of trying to remove the object — which measured almost 8 inches long and more than 2 inches wide — from the man ’ s rectum .
It ’ s believed the pervy patient inserted the item up his anus for sexual pleasure .
It is…unclear whether Iwao saves her from getting raped by the Americans or if he is simply pretending to be kind to her before raping her , but the sequence stops before it is made clear .
But , if anything , he emerged worse , with sexual aggression taking a place next to his violent destructive tendencies .
A Devil ’ s Advocate might argue that it is not outright confirmed that he is a rapist , but he comes close enough that…yeah .
Like with a lot of Japanese New Wave films , this movie ’ s approach to sex is unsettlingly ambiguous enough that it is difficult to say what we are supposed to feel except for uncomfortable .
Iwao is shown to have some intense sexual appetites .
Yes , he is older than her and has more power in the relationship , but is she not exercising her own sexual power over him in a sense ?
There is quite a bit of sex in this film and , some of it is disturbing while some is kind of…erotic .
There is a sex worker who has a small , but pivotal role in the film .
The sex workers appear to treat the job as a job , not necessarily a lifestyle or a prison , just work .
Japan has historically had a…complex…attitude towards sex work , but it had technically remained legal until 1956 , seven years before the main events of this movie .
So , there is less cultural shame towards being a sex worker , but one now has to be careful around the police .
Is the movie ’ s depiction of sex work in the 1960s realistic ?
Iwao was going to be forced into marriage with the hopes of holding him down , only for him to blow it up with pre-marital sex with Kazuko .
There is a man later on who frequently has sex with a woman , only to suddenly marry another woman .

Easy question , she ’ s an attention whore and wants to take without giving .
And if you think I ’ m unnecessarily angry , to that I say if you ’ re not angry then you ’ re not fucking paying attention .
If you are young , getting angry at the opposite sex is understandable , but it probably wont help you .
And it doesn ’ t get much better as you get older–although you will probably become more valuable to women as a whole , the number of sexually attractive women declines rapidly .
By the time your 50 , the number of women out there that pass the boner test is virtually nil .
I ’ d rather stand on my own merit alone then stand by some entitled princess who believes I should feel lucky as fuck that she even talks to me , let alone let ’ s me fuck her .
Things won ’ t get better until these women wake up and see that their feminazi bullshit is only destroying society and family .
And this PUA and Game bullshit is just perpetuating things by allowing women to delude themselves into believing that men are the problem .
That man living in his car , paying alimony and child support , to a woman he DIDN ‘ T want to divorce for children he wants to be a father to…that ’ s the fucking problem .
That man sitting in prison convicted of a rape he didn ’ t commit simply on the whim of a woman who changed her mind afterwards , that ’ s the fucking problem .
That man in prison convicted of a false domestic violence charge on the whim of a woman who played that specific card in a custody case , that ’ s the fucking problem .
That man who called the police on a physically abusive women , but he ’ s still the one arrested and taken away from the home , that ’ s the fucking problem .

In Georgia , two dozen “ volunteering ” prison inmates had gonorrhea bacteria pumped directly into their urinary tracts through the penis .
Consider this : after revelations about the government ’ s experiments spanning the 20th century spawned outrage , the government began looking for human guinea pigs in other countries , where “ clinical trials could be done more cheaply and with fewer rules. ” In Guatemala , prisoners and patients at a mental hospital were infected with syphilis , “ apparently to test whether penicillin could prevent some sexually transmitted disease. ” In Uganda , U.S.-funded doctors “ failed to give the AIDS drug AZT to all the HIV-infected pregnant women in a study… even though it would have protected their newborns. ” Meanwhile , in Nigeria , children with meningitis were used to test an antibiotic named Trovan .

The women ’ s sexual anatomy , the vulva , labia , and clitoris in particular , make up the women ’ s soft tissue that cause the most concerns and discomfort for female riders .
For the women who are considered ‘ Outies ’ , the vulva and the labia are much more pronounced and exposed , often showing as a physically larger area .
The clitoris also may be a physically larger area .
For the ‘ Innies ’ , the vulva , the labia , and the clitoris tend to be more enclosed or drawn up internally so that the crotch area is smoother .
The innies will have a smaller exposed soft tissue surface area around the opening of the vagina .

Marlo , Tully Although some would say that Atomic Blonde gives Charlize Theron her best bisexual role , the sexy assassin is not nearly as groundbreaking as this suburban siren .
Rather than a promiscuous sex pistol , in Tully , Theron portrays a bi character seldom investigated on the big screen ( although small-screen bisexual parents have been fan favorites , such as Sara Ramirez 's Callie Torres on Grey 's Anatomy and Amy Landecker 's Sara Pfefferman on Transparent ) .
A woman who spent her youth sexually exploring everything she could , Alyssa is acutely aware of the stigma most bisexuals face .
She refuses to have a threesome or cross her sexual boundaries for even the man she loves ( breaking a stereotype that bisexuals are frothing at the mouth for threesomes ) and in the end returns to dating women .
Chasing Amy is a fascinating exploration of sexual politics and the troubles bisexual women face when they take on straight partners , and Alyssa is the perfect character to pay homage to .

The opening credit sequence of “ Succession ” includes a cheeky shot of an ATN news ticker ; in Season 2 , it reads , “ gender fluid illegals may be entering the country ‘ twice. ’ ” For some viewers , Armstrong ’ s thoroughgoing commitment to a curdled view of humanity—as the Roys jockey for position , they trade such endearments as “ the cunt of Monte Cristo ” —made the show at once intolerable and irresistible .
Culture critics have popularized the term “ wealth porn ” to characterize shows , such as “ Billions ” or “ Gossip Girl , ” that lavish attention on the consumption habits of the absurdly wealthy .
But , if the shiny surface of “ Succession ” bears a relation to pornography , it is less because it titillates than because it partakes of pornography ’ s deadening relentlessness .
Upon arriving at the family ’ s Hamptons estate , Logan demands that the doors be opened , noting , “ It smells like the cheesemonger died and left his dick in the Brie. ” When Cousin Greg is grilled at a congressional hearing , he responds to one question by saying , “ Uh , if it is to be said , so it be , so it is ” —a tortured circumvention of “ Yes. ” The uneasy simultaneity of comedy and drama that “ Succession ” depends on is a consequence of Armstrong ’ s unwillingness to save his characters from themselves .
Jon Brown took a deep , if not hands-on , dive into the kind of élite sex club that serves as the setting for Tom Wambsgans ’ s bachelor party in Season 1 .
In an early draft of the scene , Brown incorporated an incident that he ’ d learned about during his investigations , in which an orgy room ’ s music speakers failed , making the slapping sound of flesh on flesh wetly audible .
“ After about one second , someone shouted , ‘ Put the fucking music on , ’ because even they didn ’ t want to hear how disgusting it was , ” he told me .
and I tell you what , I have morning fucking wood , ” Armstrong ’ s Atwater announces on page 1 .
It ’ s in the vibe of this country. ” The “ Succession ” scripts are peppered with the type of memorably lurid cursing that another British writer , Armando Iannucci , helped make a hallmark of HBO , with “ Veep. ” Armstrong has a rule : an insult “ should be at least as expressive of who the character uttering it is as it is eloquent , or ineloquent , about its target. ” At one point , Kendall warns Stewy , a onetime school friend turned business rival , “ I will come to you at night with a razor blade , and I will cut your fucking dick off ” ; Stewy airily replies , “ And then push it up your cunt until poo-poo pops out of my nose hole. ” But the show ’ s linguistic ingenuity extends well beyond scatology .
“ Like , he ’ ll say , ‘ Tom is completely freaking out—he ’ s completely shit his whack. ’ I said , ‘ Is that a British thing ? ’ Jesse said yeah , but Tony and Georgia and Jon said no .
There ’ s fear , and jealousy , and revenge and control , and they all get wrapped up in really nice fucking wrapping paper. ” As the crew arranged the scene , readying extras and setting tables , Armstrong , leaning against a honey-colored wall , said , “ That ’ s what ’ s interesting about the people in the show—hopefully , they are not incapable of honesty. ” He went on , “ Shiv is a passionate , driven , smart person , who I think occasionally gets glimpses of the way that her life could be integrated and whole and truthful .

The main reason behind the tearing of the hymen is sexual intercourse .
However , there are other reasons the hymen ruptures besides sexual intercourse , including strenuous physical activity or tampon use .
Hymenoplasty can increase sexual satisfaction , as this procedure also tightens the vaginal wall .
After having children , the vaginal walls become enlarged , which gives a 'loose ' feeling during sexual intercourse .
Many women opt for a Hymenoplasty in order to rejuvenate their love lives and increase sensation during intercourse .
Restored Virginity Undergoing Hymenoplasty can also act as as a form of abstinence from sex .
This is because you can not indulge in sexual intercourse immediately after going through the hymenoplasty .
When you do engage in sexual intercourse for the first time after the procedure , you will experience the same feeling as if it was your first time .
After having intercourse with your spouse after the procedure , there will be some resistance and bleeding , which is a sign of virginity .
If you have been sexually assaulted or abused , a Hymenoplasty is a way to restore what was forcefully taken from you .
This is because the basic function of the hymen is to protect the entrance of the vagina from things such as dirt and microorganisms ( and other things that can infect the vagina ) .
It also promotes better blood circulation in the vagina .
The most recent available data show that alcohol causes nearly 7,000 cancer deaths each year in Canada , with most cases being breast or colon cancer , followed by cancers of the rectum , mouth and throat , liver , esophagus and larynx .

New judgment : R ( Coll ) v Secretary of State for Justice [ 2017 ] UKSC 40 This appeal considered whether the arrangements for placing prisoners in Approved Premises ( APs ) upon release from custody gave rise to unlawful sex discrimination , either direct or indirect .
The Court held that it was not necessary for the appellant to show that every female prisoner required to live at an AP has suffered the detriment of being placed at an AP far from her home in order to establish a case of direct discrimination on grounds of sex , and considered that the risk of being placed far from home is much greater for women than for men due to the smaller numbers of female offenders , and the policy decision that the particular vulnerability of women required to live in an AP means that all APs should be single sex .
Larner – How children and young people disclose sexual abuse 7 December 2018 7 December 2018 / Claire The FORGE is delighted to announce our first external guest speaker : Dr Sam Larner ( MMU ) .
Details of his talk are below : How Children and Young People Disclose Sexual Abuse : A linguistic analysis of NSPCC ChildLine online chat transcripts Research indicates that when children and young people make the difficult decision to disclose that they have been sexually abused , their linguistic capabilities may limit the extent to which they can make a full and clear disclosure .
In order to provide a novel perspective , this research addresses the question ‘ How do children and young people disclose that they have been sexually abused ? ’ Online chat conversations in which sexual abuse was disclosed ( n=40 ) between children and young people ( aged 10—18 years old ) and ChildLine counsellors were analysed .
Whilst some children and young people do use explicit terms to describe sexual abuse , these are predominantly used to seek definitions and clarification .
Furthermore , counsellors play an instrumental role in recognising that a disclosure is being made , and then eliciting and reframing the disclosure as sexual abuse .
The findings provide insight into why some victims of sexual abuse report having attempted to tell an adult but feel like they were not heard .
In her excellent article , “ The Ongoing Damages of The Silence of the Lambs ’ s Buffalo Bill 30 Years On ” , Stephanie Markwell writes “ This idea of the autogynephilic trans woman was popularised by The Silence of the Lambs – Bill ’ s mission to “ become ” a woman is entirely informed by his sexual perversions , as mentioned earlier .
I 'd * * * * me hard ... '' all the while becoming aroused , playing with their nipples , etc .
writes : “ It is generally accepted within psychology and among trans health providers that transgender people who transition do so because they have a gender identity that is incongruent with their birth-assigned sex , and distinct from their sexual orientation .
In contradiction to this standard model , the theory of autogynephilia posits that transgender women ’ s female gender identities and transitions are merely a by-product of their sexual orientations .
and “ Autogynephilia is a paraphilic model that states that all male-to-female ( MtF ) transsexuals who are not exclusively attracted toward men are instead sexually oriented toward the thought or image of themselves as a woman .
The assertion that transsexual women are sexually motivated in their transitions challenges the standard model of transsexualism—that is , that transsexuals have a gender identity that is distinct from their sexual orientation and incongruent with their physical sex. ” ( 5 . )

Question : Do n't you think your site has too much `` sexual stuff/violence '' ?
In all honesty , most fan fiction that 's written is relationship-based , and often those relationships are sexual in nature .

“ Lou Marsh ” honors the memory of the social worker who attempted to intervene in a Spanish Harlem gang brawl and paid for that choice with his life : He felt their blinding hatred And he tried to save their lives And the answer that they gave him Was their fists and feet and knives You have to have your head up your ass ( like a certain music critic whose name escapes me at the moment ) not to perceive the lasting relevance of this song .

It does not indicate gender Transgender : A broad term for people whose gender identities don ’ t match assigned sex at birth Transman : A person assigned female sex at birth who identifies with a male gender and/or body Transwoman : A person assigned male sex at birth who identifies with a female gender and/or body In the nearly three years since Friedenbach graduated , the transgender movement has grown—at Mount Holyoke , on other campuses nationwide , and beyond the higher education landscape .
The point of contention was that the plaintiffs insisted that Judge Walker ’ s interest in ( heterosexual or homosexual ) marriage is as irrelevant as any other judge ’ s would be , and that to argue that his sexuality made it relevant was an act of discrimination .
The defense was of the view that Judge Walker ’ s homosexuality put him in a unique position of possibly “ sitting in judgment of his own case ” , especially if he was in a long-term relationship with someone of the same sex .
There has been in this magnificent determination and solidarity of our race more evidence of weakening among the men than there has been among the women ; and if you can not answer adversely to the women the questions which I have asked , on what grounds of justice , fairness , or wisdom are you going to refuse the sex the vote because they are wholly unfit to comprehend an Imperial question ?
I shrink from challenging such authority by saying that what we have in evidence is the evidence of our senses day by day—our ordinary intercourse with our friends , with those whom we meet anywhere , and , above all , the House of Commons , regarded for the moment not as a body of representative men speaking for their constituents , but as a specimen body of English citizens .
No one can foresee what will be the outcome of adding 6,000,000 women to the list of voters , but this House has now to choose between consenting to take that plunge and setting itself against a palpable desire in favour of that plunge among the people at large , the result of which we see in our common intercourse , in the votes of the House of Commons , and in the total absence of any organised protest even attempted on a large scale .
Then the noble and learned Lord , the Lord Chancellor , in speaking to-day , said one thing which astonished me considerably—namely , that in spite of this proposal having been made , in spite of the importance of the issues which will fall to be decided after the war , in some of which women will be profoundly interested , it would be no insult to them , and they would be wrong in regarding it as an insult , to have these subsections quietly swept out of the Bill , and they must continue to be ruled and governed by the other sex in the future as in the past .
You are going to remove the pauper disqualification in this Bill ; of the three classes that remain , there is a hope that lunatics may one day cease to be lunatics ; children certainly will cease to be children—provided that they are of the male sex ; 492 and it is only in the case of women that , as a class , at all times , in all circumstances , and at all ages , they are definitely excluded , together with paupers and lunatics , from exercising the rights of citizenship and voting for Members of Parliament .
It is illogical because , at the very moment that you are abolishing , or affecting to abolish , the sex disqualification , you say that a soldier at nineteen may have a vote at the next Election because he is a man , but that a woman may not have a vote until she reaches the age of thirty because she is a female .
I want the owners to appoint the best people possible to run the club , whether they are Arsenal fans or not , but given everything that ’ s happened in the last couple of months , to promise to attend a meeting once every 365 days isn ’ t going to convince anyone you give more than a tiny little shit one way or the other .

The Proliferation of Porn GIFs por admin | Ene 13 , 2022 | PornGifs.ca Although the ease of access to porn GIFS is great for adults who love to watch porn , it ’ s problematic for millions of kids who aren ’ t old enough to be able to watch it .
Until recently , pornography was only for adults .

While porn GIFs have endured years of censorship , they are not a viable option for everyone .
You don ’ t need any special editing skills however , you ’ ll need patience and an eye for sexuality .
You can also create porn GIFs on numerous websites .

The effects will vary and will depend on the child ’ s age , sex of the child , the strength of the family bond , and how the divorcing parents will cooperate during the dissolution of the marriage ( Dacey & Travers , 2002 ) .

I think you have to separate this out from the other issue that ’ s taking place in the nursing homes right now about whether older adults are allowed to have a sex life .
Eric : The “ ick ” factor for me would be if he was pretending to be her husband , which would seem … Kathryn : It ’ s taking sexual advantage … You could take this same scenario and move it out of there into any other adult situation… Eric : A dark corner in a bar , where you think … Kathryn : We would not think this was okay .
Alex : Right , an inebriated person or somebody who ’ s been given some one of these date rape drugs , for example , to make them forget , a temporary dementia , so to speak .
Kathryn : Would she be just as satisfied buying him gifts , having dinner with him , spending the evening with him , or did she truly want the sexual relationship ?

There had been very few times in Leigh 's life that she 'd thrown all caution to the wind and decided fuck the consequences ... even now , she was sure that no matter what happened between her and Jared eventually , they would be adult about it .
So fuck it .
It was n't a throwdown ... but close enough to make Leigh 's pussy clench with eagerness .
She had n't had sex in so long either ... and Leigh liked sex .
Loved sex .
Wanted sex with Jared .
One hand clutched at his shoulder as the other tried to slide between their bodies ... yeah , she was going straight for the cock .
Being held down while he kissed her so deeply and desperately , while she writhed underneath him and felt his cock pressing up against her pussy through their clothes ?
I 've got about 4-5 chapters left to write , then I 'm going out of town right after Thanksgiving and then I 'll be editing my butt off = ) It 's possible that this book may go up early for pre-order just because of the chain of events ... it depends on whether or not I manage to finish it before leaving for vacation .
I 'm going to be hauling butt to try to get Marriage Training to the agent , finally , and then focusing on getting a surprise project finished and some more Dark Angel titles out ( second book in the Planets Apart series and some that are re-writes of Literotica work ) .
It was more embarrassing than sexy to be stripped down to her panties ... a little exciting too , but she could n't help but feel shy .
The rumbling chuckle that followed her ungraceful flop just made her blush harder , but embarrassment was n't the emotion which spread warmth through her body when Jared 's big hand came down to rest on her butt cheek .
Just one covered most of her cheek , and it was n't like she had a small ass .
Her hips , butt and thighs were kind of out of proportion with her slim upper body , but it did n't seem like Jared was complaining as he caressed her .
The warmth spreading through her pooled in her center , making her pussy get even wetter .
Especially when she felt the hard bulge of his cock pressing against her side .
Jared gave her butt a light slap , more sound than sensation , but it was enough to make her jump slightly in surprise .
A shiver went down her spine as he rubbed his hand across her ass , as if readying the whole surface in preparation for what was to come .
The fabric of her panties was much thinner than her jeans , and she was feeling really grateful that she had n't worn a thong , even if the flimsy underwear was n't exactly protection .
The last part of his speech could have sounded corny or sexy , but in Jared 's deep tones that did n't contain even a hint of amusement anymore , it sounded kind of scary .
But then he stepped forward , his focus narrowing , and his eyes were suddenly hot and hungry and so very intent ... Leigh felt her thighs clenching , pressing down on her pussy as Jared suddenly , and for the first time , went completely Dom on her .
Oh geezus ... his deep , velvety voice rumbled through her and she felt her nipples tightening .
Leigh 's nipples throbbed as his hand dangled down near her breast and she had to quell the urge to twist her body so that he 'd actually be touching her there .
Leigh had a feeling that Olivia would cheer for Jared having sexual relations with an animal before getting back together with his ex .
Who knew that Jared going all sexy and commanding on her would rock her so badly ?
I 'll give the same spiel I gave Facebook - there 's gon na be crazy `` take me back '' antics , a public spanking , almost sex between exes , magic pussy , a proposal , a rejection of a proposal , a fight , some injuries , a hospital visit and a pregnancy .
IRL I have all my cosplay stuff that 's going on , my friends , a wedding this weekend , my family , and hubby ... our 4 year wedding anniversary is tomorrow = ) Our tradition is to order Chinese food and watch our wedding video , usually followed by sex and then watching something nerdy .
It 'll be nice to get away for the weekend and celebrate good friends getting married =D Plus ... hotel sex .
I do n't know why but hubby and I just love hotel sex .
To know what it was like to have sex with other women .
Until this most recent break up , they 'd only ever had sex with each other .
Enough to know that , while sex could be fun without emotion , she preferred it with .
Lucky bastard .
It made him laugh and that made her feel good because she liked to see him laugh ... Ah fuck it .
I 've told my friends that I 'm a cosplay masochist because I always choose complicated shit ( which is kind of good cuz it 's always pushing me to learn new things and improve ) but now I 'm starting to think that maybe I 'm a life masochist too .

So on Friday when the judge ’ s ruling was announced , two men I love very much – like so much I would lay down my life for them – made a mad , crazy dash to the courthouse and were the first same sex couple to get a Wisconsin marriage license .
This one is reportedly based on the 1999 book A Vast Conspiracy : The Real Story of the Sex Scandal That Nearly Brought Down a President , written by Jeffrey Toobin , whom you may remember from his time masturbating on Zoom in front of his coworkers .
After being widely demonized at the time of the scandal , during which it was revealed that as an intern she had sex ( though not intercourse , she maintained ) with her boss , Clinton .
Appearing before the senators were Lt Jr Grade Jenny Kopfstein , Maj Michael Almy and Gen John Sheehan -- the first two were drummed out of the military for their sexuality , the third was rewarded with a lengthy career ( possibly in part due his homophobia ) .
Although the policy is referred to as Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell , as the law is currently written members of the armed forces are involuntarily separated regardless how their sexual orientation is disclosed .
And I can tell you for a fact , in that moment , neither my captain nor the Petty Officer that worked for me , cared one whit about my sexuality .
The phrase Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell implies a mutual agreement where the services would not inquire about the sexual preferences of our members and the military personnel would not publicly articulate your sexual oreintation .

The narrative is punctuated with nightly shots of a double motel-room bed ( a configuration familiar from Calle ’ s L ’ Hotel series ) and her voice-over lamentation : “ No sex last night. ” Equally accented is Shepard ’ s relationship to his car , creating a kind of onanistic version of the North American preoccupation with the automobile seen in Robert Frank ’ s The Americans .

Somalia : Call for urgent action following ‘ alarming ’ 80 per cent rise in sexual violence © UNICEF/Kate Holt The UN says there has been an alarming increase in the scale and severity of sexual violence in Somalia .
5 August 2021 Human Rights An “ alarming ” 80 per cent increase in sexual violence in Somalia , as documented in two recent reports by the Secretary-General , has been described as “ appalling ” by two UN Special Representatives .
documented that in 2020 , 400 civilians , primarily girls , were victims of rape and other forms of sexual violence .
More than 100 cases of sexual violence against girls were verified by the UN in the first quarter of 2021 .
Insecurity in Somalia The report linked sexual violence to the prevailing conditions of insecurity in Somalia .
Cases of sexual violence ​​attributed to Al-Shabaab has doubled , the report found , describing how the Islamist militant group continues to use sexual violence and forced marriage to dominate areas under their de facto control .
The two senior UN experts also expressed serious concern that over 15 per cent of all cases of sexual violence verified , were attributed to the Government security forces .
Both the Somali National Army and the Somali Police Force , as well as regional forces , committed acts of rape and other forms of sexual violence against women and children .
Concrete action The Special Representatives have urged the Government of Somalia to take concrete measures to prevent sexual violence against women and children .
They highlighted the importance of the 2012 action plan on ending the recruitment of children as soldiers and the 2019 road map , which establishes mechanisms for the prevention of sexual violence against children .
They further urged the Government to swiftly adopt a new national action plan on ending sexual violence in conflict .
This will reinforce the policy of zero tolerance within the security sector and help to strengthen institutional capacity to effectively prevent and respond to conflict-related sexual violence .

Once again , Bill Cosby is being accused of sexual assault and rape .
And once again , his representatives are dismissing the accusers as scammers who are looking for a payout and trying to convince us that all of these dozens of women who have accused the disgraced comedian of sexual violence are all lying on a perfectly innocent man .
The lawsuit alleges that these companies are “ culpable and liable ” and “ knew and/or should have known Bill Cosby was sexually abusing , assaulting , and/or battering women , including on their premises , but did nothing to stop it , ” as Vulture reported .
Bernard alleged that Cosby sexually assaulted her again in 1991 at his home in Manhattan .
Eventually , Cosby touched her breasts and forcibly pushed his genitals against her back , kissed her neck without consent , and then remarked , “ This is all we were going to do .
Gittens claimed that around the late 1980s , Cosby invited her to his home on multiple occasions for “ mentoring , ” and during one of these meetings in 1989 or 1990 , he gave her a drugged glass of wine and “ anally penetrated her with his finger. ” Thompson alleged that Cosby forced her to touch his penis and masturbate him at his home around 1988 .
These claims are similar to all of the sexual assault and rape claims made against Cosby .
As we have always stated , and now America can see , this isn ’ t about justice for victims of alleged sexual assault , it ’ s ALL ABOUT MONEY , ” Wyatt told the Times via email .
Perhaps he ’ s pointing at Cosby ’ s 2018 sexual assault conviction being overturned last year .
Also , if that case is supposed to vindicate Cosby , the fact that jurors found that Cosby sexually assaulted a teenager at the Playboy Mansion in 1975 should do the opposite , should it not ?

After she was finally released from jail the next day , Lopez said she went directly to the hospital where a rape kit was collected .

The Harris County Jail released a statement confirming that it is currently investigating the incident : “ The Harris County Sheriff ’ s Office is investigating an allegation that a female jail inmate was sexually assaulted by an employee inside the Harris County Jail in early March .
The Harris County Sheriff ’ s Office takes these allegations seriously , and we are committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of all inmates entrusted in our care. ” In a study from the United States Department of Justice published in 2013 , the Harris County Jail was listed as having one of the worst rates of sexual assault in the country .
Harris County also made headlines when dash camera footage was released that showed two sheriff ’ s deputies stripping a 21-year-old college student naked in public , forcing her to lie down on the side of the road , and then raping her for 10 minutes , after they pulled her over for allegedly running a stop sign and then claimed they needed to conduct a “ vaginal cavity search ” because they “ smelled marijuana. ” Emma Lopez has now filed a lawsuit against the City of Katy , the Harris County Sheriff ’ s Office and Sheriff Ed Gonzales , the officer who arrested her and the unnamed jail guard who raped her .
She claimed that her Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated from the moment she was falsely arrested to the moment she was sexually assaulted , and she has been forced to endure mental , emotional and psychical anguish as a result .

But if we ’ re not sure of someone ’ s gender , religion , citizenry , sexual orientation or race , we can get very uptight .
We have impossible beauty standards , we get paid less than men , we are often not taken seriously , we are abused , we are shamed for having sex , and what we can and can ’ t do with our bodies is regulated by men who will never understand our medical needs .
Black women and girls are often perceived as being more sexually promiscuous—and at a younger age—than white women .
Pauline , who has intellectual disabilities , has been with the Arc program since 2014 , after an emergency removal from her previous caretaker ’ s home by Adult Protective Services when she was sexually assaulted .
At a time when more women are speaking up about sexual assault — and naming the men who assault or harass them — Pauline , too , wants her story told .
NPR obtained unpublished Justice Department data on sex crimes .
The results show that people with intellectual disabilities — women and men — are the victims of sexual assaults at rates more than seven times those for people without disabilities .
It ’ s one of the highest rates of sexual assault of any group in America , and it ’ s hardly talked about at all .
( NPR uses rape survivors ’ first name , unless they prefer their full name be used . )
At a conference in a large ballroom , Leigh Ann Davis asked the audience in front of her a question : How many of them had dealt with sexual assault or sexual harassment in their lives ?
Then Davis posed a second question : How many in the audience knew someone with an intellectual disability who had been the victim of sexual harassment or assault ?
“ Where people with intellectual disabilities are more likely to be victimized , but we don ’ t see more hands being raised. ” Davis focuses on the issue of sexual violence .
She is familiar with the high number of rape reports among people with intellectual disabilities .
NPR reviewed hundreds of cases of sexual assault against people with intellectual disabilities .
We found that there is an epidemic of sexual abuse against people with intellectual disabilities .
But the report doesn ’ t break out sex crimes against people with intellectual disabilities .
When NPR requested those data , she came up with the stunning numbers that show people with intellectual disabilities are sexually assaulted at much higher numbers — “ more than seven times higher than the rate for persons with no disabilities. ” “ If this were any other population , the world would be up in arms , ” says Nancy Thaler , a deputy secretary of Pennsylvania ’ s Department of Human Services who runs the state ’ s developmental disability programs .
Vulnerable everywhere Most rape victims — in general — are assaulted by someone they know , not by a stranger .
For women without disabilities , the rapist is a stranger 24 percent of the time , but for a woman with an intellectual disability it is less than 14 percent of the time .
Half the sexual assaults take place during the day .
For the rest of the population , about 40 percent of sexual assaults occur during daytime .
“ It was a predator ’ s dream ” Stephen DeProspero is serving 40 years in prison for filming himself sexually assaulting a severely disabled 10-year-old boy he cared for at a state institution in New Hartford , N.Y. “ There was nothing in the back of my mind that caused me to seek out a job with vulnerable people so I could take advantage of them , ” he wrote in response to a query from NPR .
He blames his crime on an addiction to pornography , including child pornography .
NPR wrote to several men in prison or awaiting trial for sexually abusing an adult or child with an intellectual disability .
Some claimed that the sex was consensual .
“ My memory of child porn videos sprang back into my mind , ” he says , and he forced the boy to perform a sex act .
But first he went back to sexually assault the boy one more time , and this time filmed it as “ a momento [ sic ] to remember him. ” That act , too , went unnoticed .
Police investigating Internet child porn seized DeProspero ’ s computer and cameras — and found images of children .
In 2012 , a jury in Georgia found a man guilty of raping a 24-year-old woman with Down syndrome three times over one night and the following morning .
Appeals Court Judge Christopher McFadden , two years later , overturned the decision , saying the woman did not “ behave like a victim. ” McFadden , who presided over the original trial , questioned why the woman waited a day to report the rape and said that she did not exhibit “ visible distress. ” The jury had heard evidence that the man ’ s semen was found in the victim ’ s bed and that a doctor who examined the woman found evidence consistent with a sexual assault .
The trial was for damages for a 9-year-old girl who had been sexually assaulted five times by an older boy at her school .
That ’ s where the rape happened .
Both boys , according to the complaint , “ confessed to raping the victim and both related that the victim repeatedly told both juveniles to stop assaulting her. ” It was McClain who called the police that night .
But after police charged the boys with rape , McClain seemed to have second thoughts .
Telling the woman with an intellectual disability that maybe it wasn ’ t really rape , that she ’ d enjoyed the sex .
That was just days before the sexual assault in Pennsylvania .
But Pauline says that in the days after the sexual assault in Pennsylvania , there was a lot of tension .
“ She said , ‘ It ’ s your fault , Pauline. ’ ” Pauline pauses , and then reassures herself : “ It ’ s not your fault. ” On Feb. 22 , two days after the assault , McClain called Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Shamus Kelleher , who had investigated the rape .
She told the officer that Pauline had changed her story and now said the sex acts had been consensual and that Pauline said she “ enjoyed it. ” But when Kelleher asked to talk to Pauline , McClain refused to let Pauline speak .
In his complaint , Kelleher noted that McClain ’ s claim that Pauline had agreed to sex with the boys had been made “ solely ” by McClain “ and was not in any way verified by the victim even after requested by this Trooper. ” Kelleher already had a sense of Pauline .
Then , on March 1 , the night before the boys were to appear in juvenile court , McClain took Pauline — the rape victim — to the office of the public defender who was representing one of the boys — a rape suspect .
McClain told the lawyer that the sex acts were consensual .
Kelleher wrote in the police complaint that rather than hearing — as McClain claimed — Pauline retracting her story , he heard “ a heated discussion regarding the sexual assaults. ” Police ordered McClain to turn over her cellphone with the recordings as potential evidence .
That ’ s all she knew. ” There ’ s long been reluctance by many prosecutors to take on rape cases against people with intellectual disabilities .
According to court records , the two boys were charged with rape , involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and other sex crimes .
And when McClain told authorities a different story — that it wasn ’ t rape but consensual sex — she thinks police and prosecutors refused to believe her because they thought she was now fearful of losing Pauline ’ s Social Security disability benefits .
They want things other adults want : jobs and community ; friendships , relationships — and that includes romantic relationships , sex , and maybe marriage .
In 32 states , according to an NPR count of state statutes , the same laws that protect children from physical and sexual abuse are used to protect adults with intellectual disabilities .
But like so many other adults with intellectual disabilities , a history of rape gets in the way .
Being the nosy person I am , I peeked over at his computer ( he didn ’ t see me ) , and was greeted by a picture of a vagina in extreme close up .

More people can sue over sexual abuse As the # MeToo movement inspired more people to come forward with their experiences of sexual abuse , some states are relaxing their deadlines to bring lawsuits for previous offenses .
The state is also expanding the statute of limitations for childhood victims of sexual abuse .
Illinois will remove the statute of limitations on criminal sexual assault , aggravated criminal sexual assault and aggravated criminal sexual abuse , regardless of the age of the victim .
The state eliminated time limits on prosecuting sex crimes against minors in 2017 , but adult victims still faced a ticking clock .
But there are exceptions , including cases involving sex crimes , domestic violence , witness intimidation or tampering and terrorism-related charges , among others .

The calorie demand for a person ’ s height , age , sex , as well as activity degree can all impact the number of calories an individual must take in .
‘ Our tales are spun ’ , Dennett writes , ‘ but for most part we don ’ t spin them , they spin us. ’ Similarly , the postmodern historian Jeffrey Weekes argues that , ‘ The individual is constituted in the world of language and symbols which come to dwell in , and constitute , the individual. ’ In his comic novel , Nice Work , David Lodge satirises postmodernism in the person of Dr Robyn Penrose ( Temporary Lecturer in English Literature at the University of Rummidge ) , for whom ‘ there is no such thing as the “ self ” … there is only a subject position in an infinite web of discourses – the discourses of power , sex , family , science , religion , poetry , etc. ’ And for whom ‘ there is no such thing as an author ’ , because ‘ Every text is a product of intertextuality , a tissue of allusions to and citations of other texts ’ .
This same data suggests sex , age of diet initiation , and the composition of the remaining calories can have a significant impact on the degree of benefit from caloric restriction ; some regimens show greater benefit than others , but these differences lack sufficient consistency to clearly indicate the determining factors .

This University and Planned Parenthood are Teaming Up to Fund a “ Sex Week ” on Campus State | Micaiah Bilger | Feb 12 , 2016 | 12:08PM | Salt Lake City , UT Disconnecting sex from responsibility is something Planned Parenthood works to hard to do on college campuses across the nation .
More sex without commitments means more abortions , which means more money for Planned Parenthood .
“ Students for Choice is hoping that this week will reduce the stigma around sex , provide students with healthy reproductive services and resources , and also create opportunities for students and faculty to engage with the reproductive justice framework , ” Kaur said .
“ Students and faculty should attend events during Sex Week to engage in a larger conversation on campus about consent and reproductive justice. ” “ Sex Week was intentionally organized right before the Valentine ’ s Day weekend , so students could access free condoms and safe sex that they may or may not use during the weekend , ” she continued , adding that she believes in Utah the current education system fails to empower students to embrace and love their sexuality .
Last year , the campus pro-life group asked that the event be moved off campus because of its immature promotion of sex without responsibility , but the request was ignored , according to Barbwire .
The Right to Life of UU sent a letter to the Center for Student Wellness , saying that Sex Week “ encourages sexual partners to view each other as objects used for pleasure ” and the event ’ s immature nature overshadows the important education about unplanned pregnancies and STDs .
Planned Parenthood ’ s sexual education programs in public schools and colleges are well-known for promoting dangerous behavior .
In 2014 , Live Action release a video of Planned Parenthood employees telling young teenage girls that “ stop , ” really doesn ’ t always mean , “ stop ” and encouraging them to participate in sado-masochistic sexual activities , including gagging , whipping , asphyxiation , shopping at sex stores , and viewing pornography .
In the International Planned Parenthood Federation ’ s booklet for HIV-positive youth , “ Healthy , Happy and Hot , ” it claims that it should be a “ human right ” not to tell your sexual partner that you have HIV , LifeNews previously reported .
Additionally , the abortion giant has published multiple “ resources ” for children and teenagers concerning sexual activity .
These materials claim to provide “ age appropriate ” sex education to children starting at age four .
Planned Parenthood justifies starting sex-education at such a young age by stating , “ Ideally , medical accurate sexuality education would be taught each year in our schools from pre-kindergarten to 12th grade . ”

At a rape trial , it was error requiring reversal for the judge , on two occasions , to interrupt defense counsel 's final argument to instruct the jury , in effect , that they should not consider any inadequacies of the police investigation of the crime , including failure of the police to perform scientific tests , where the judge 's action prevented defense counsel from arguing permissible inferences that could have raised a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jurors , and also infringed the jury 's right to draw inferences from the absence of certain evidence .
[ 744-746 ] Where the evidence at a trial of an indictment for rape , including testimony by the defendant as to his version of the events , provided a rational basis for a jury to acquit the defendant of rape and to convict him of the lesser included offense of assault and battery , the defendant was entitled to a jury instruction on assault and battery as a lesser included offense .
The defendant appeals from his conviction of rape , arguing ( 1 ) that the judge erred in instructing the jury not to consider the closing argument of defense counsel regarding the inconclusiveness of the Commonwealth 's scientific tests and its failure to produce certain evidence , and ( 2 ) that the judge erred in refusing to instruct the jury on assault and battery as a lesser included offense to the crime of rape .
The defendant bent the victim 's fingers back to halt her struggle , and had sexual intercourse with her despite her resistance .
In addition , one of the the victim 's fingers was swollen , there was a small laceration on the left side of her nose , finger markings on the inside of her left thigh , and an abrasion in her vagina .
The defendant testified that he , without using physical force , tried for several minutes to persuade the victim to have sex with him .
The defendant denied having engaged in intercourse with the victim .
Because it is likely to recur at a new trial , we address the defendant 's contention that the judge erred in declining to instruct the jury on assault and battery as a lesser included offense to the crime of rape .
We have stated that a defendant may be convicted of assault and battery on an indictment charging rape .

What can be said for writer and director Bob Clark ’ s film is that the primary aim throughout is clearly to provide crude , sexual humour , and in that sense Porky ’ s has to be seen as something of a success .

This might be the last new movie for awhile , I will truly try to see the Mr. Rogers movie this weekend but things have went ever so slightly south which sucks man .
The story starts out very disconnected and fragmented , following Danny Torrence all grown up and helping a young girl with the same gifts from a band of people who are kind of a cross between immortals from Highlander , and the Dementors from Harry Potter , able to literally suck all the shining out of individuals and further boost their own power .
It dips very lightly into actual Shining territory until the end and while others may bitch and moan about it having to use the film as a crutch , I greatly enjoyed it and they showed amazing attention to detail and honestly some of the actors looked identical to the original cast .
Now a lot of people have written this film off as just arthouse porn , but I could n't disagree more with that , yes it fully warrants that R rating and nearly got a NC-17 rating cause God forbid you show a nipple even though all the more smutty scenes and topics could n't be less erotic if they tried .
It really does put it all into perspective , I 'd be terrified beyond words to live in the 1960s at my age now and some people bitch and moan about today 's state of the country but the 60s was an entire different beast .

It ’ s disappointing that Eastwood and screenwriter Billy Ray ( “ Shattered Glass ” ) decided to go this route , as even Wilde admitted via a lengthy Twitter thread on Dec. 12 that none of her research on the late reporter , who passed away in 2001 at the age of 42 , pointed to the film ’ s suggestion that Scruggs exchanged sexual favors for news tips .

And indeed , she has long been willing to “ talk about those things. ” Her groundbreaking 1972 book , Memoirs of an Ex-Prom Queen , was her way of introducing “ those things ” to the world ; of exposing truths about women and sex that simply weren ’ t being told .
Both women seem to be really into sex , but most of the sex they have is bad .
“ One of my goals was to show bad sex , ” she explains .
“ But I don ’ t think [ Sasha ’ s ] ‘ into ’ sex .
I think she has a lot of sex , not because she wants it , but because she is repeatedly in a situation where she has to have it .
I wanted to portray her as someone with agency , but the limitations that sexism and misogyny imposed on her at every turn made it very difficult for her to do what she wanted. ” When I ask Shulman if she is surprised that women are still having such bad sex , her response is swift .
I think it takes a lot of trust and caring for good sex to happen—for women at least. ” By Debbie Stoller Photograph by Mario Ettlinger This piece originally appeared in the Winter 2020 print edition of BUST Magazine .

You won ’ t be able to claim for “ risk assessment ” now in any cases that aren ’ t sexual abuse .
The work to be done is over and above that requiring independent social work expertise , for example where : • There is a substantiated criminal allegation relevant to the case in the immediate background of the case ( such as a conviction or pending proceedings for a sex offence ) ; and • A finding of sexual abuse relevant to the case has been made by a court c.the report is specifically required to address the risk posed as a result of the above factors .
One in two women have been sexually harassed at work – Week 25 “ Girls learn from a young age that they have to do things to avoid drawing attention to themselves .
This interpretation means that when women are twice as scared in public spaces ( as I wrote about in week 24 ) and when half of women have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace , we look to the victim and blame them for their fear or their reaction , rather than thinking about what the perpetrators should do to stop their behaviour .
Here is a sprinkling of findings from the TUC , which goes to show the range of harassment perpetrated against women in the workplace : More than half ( fifty two per cent ) of all women polled have experienced some form of sexual harassment .
Thirty-five per cent of women have heard comments of a sexual nature being made about other women in the workplace .
Thirty-two per cent of women have been subject to unwelcome jokes of a sexual nature .
Twenty-eight per cent of women have been subject to comments of a sexual nature about their body or clothes .
One fifth of women have experienced unwanted sexual advances .
More than one in ten women reported experiencing unwanted sexual touching or attempts to kiss them .
Four out of five women did not report the sexual harassment to their employer .
At this stage I ’ d like to mention the following research : England Athletics ’ findings that “ 32 percent of British women in a poll of 2,000 say they have encountered catcalls , abuse or unwanted attention while training in public ” * “ Over a third ( 37 % ) of female students at mixed-sex schools have personally experienced some form of sexual harassment at school. ” ^^ “ Almost a quarter ( 23 % ) of females aged between 16 and 30 have been sexually harassed at work but only 8 % have reported it , according to a poll for the Young Women ’ s Trust ” ( It ’ s ( still ) A Rich Man ’ s World ) * * * 85 % of women aged 18-24 have experienced unwanted sexual attention in public places and 45 % have experienced unwanted sexual touching ( which can amount to sexual assault ) according to a YouGov/End Violence Against Women Coalition survey ^ This is a demonstration of just some of the serious statistics around harassment of women and what I hope will give critics pause for thought before croaking out the usual ( unwelcome ) refrains of : ‘ yeah , but what about X-only-loosely-related-theme ? ’ ‘ yeah , yeah , but that ’ s only one piece of research ’ ‘ yeah , yeah , yeah , but not all men ’ ‘ yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , sexism/feminism/women are fake news ’ .
The report makes clear a number of things that government and employers can do to combat sexual harassment in the workplace and these are all worth a read , but I ’ d like to argue that fighting against the prevalence of harassment isn ’ t just about the workplace ( though this article began with that fact ) but rather about how we view sexism , discrimination and abuse in all its forms across all of society .
because at the heart of the solutions to issues such as the prevalence of sexual harassment of women is firstly recognising that the issue exists , and secondly framing the issue in a way that considers how we would behave if we didn ’ t assume that the behaviour was normal and therefore insurmountable .
Just a few of the methods that have improved women ’ s lives dramatically have been : the launch of SafetiPin which has seen 90 % of the lighting deficit in Delhi fixed ; the the redevelopment of Plaça de la Llibertat near Barcelona which saw women actually consulted on their needs ahead of work ; and the work of No Means No in Nairobi , where three-quarters of boys trained by the organisation have successfully intervened in a violent or sexual assault on a woman .
We need to internalise the fact that women should not feel twice as scared in public spaces ; nor should half of women have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace ; a third of women shouldn ’ t have been harassed while out jogging .
We all have a role to play in fighting this behaviour , and as the YouGov/EVAW survey showed , “ only 11 % of women reported that someone else intervened when they experienced unwanted sexual touching in a public place , while 81 % said they would have liked someone to do so. ” As Morela Hernandez writes “ men , by virtue of their majority position , have a unique opportunity to directly combat gender discrimination ” but I believe that statement is true for anyone of privilege or in a position of power .
Finally , I ’ m writing this just a week after Emma Watson launched the UK ’ s only sexual harassment helpline for women in the UK .

To strengthen Dutch political and economic domination , social relations were regulated , including race and gender relations .

Coen may have not been too successful in regulating the sex life of his officers , but he was certainly successful in expanding the Dutch Empire , making him a hero of the Dutch Golden Age , at least until recent reflection .
The Dutch Golden Age was made possible through economic exploitation , slavery , political oppression , and racial and sexual subjugation .

In this passage , the Corinthian ’ s seem to be arguing : when you are hungry you eat , when you want sex you have it .

The Corinthian ’ s apparently thought that one would be more spiritual that one would abstain from sexual relations totally .
However , you need to put this with chapter 6 where are committing sexual sin .

It is good not to have sexual relations , obviously .
Some of them were apparently arguing that it is okay to be married but we are not going to have sexual relations which might explain perhaps why some are going to prostitutes .
It is because they are not having any sexual relations in marriage .
Verses 2-5 say , ‘ because of sexual immorality , each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. ’ This is part of Paul ’ s view of marriage and he says your rule shouldn ’ t be followed ultimately because it will lead people into sin .
Part of that view says that regular sexual relations are necessary in marriage in verse 3 .
You just can ’ t say to someone , not to have sexual relations .
It is saying that healthy marriages have regular sexual relations and if it doesn ’ t happen , it is going to lead to sin , Paul is saying .
Verse 5 , it says that you shouldn ’ t refuse one another sexually except by agreement that you both might commit yourselves to prayer and fasting .
This is not permission to have sex out of marriage .
In verses 8 and 9 , Paul says , ‘ to the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single as I am. ’ But if you have strong sexual desires , you should get married .
Those who can ’ t marry have to trust God , but at the same time there is no excuse for sexual sin .
I think remarriage is permitted in case of sexual sin .

So the bigger question isn ’ t , “ What is the origin of homosexuality ? ” or even , “ What is the origin of my sexual orientation ? ” — questions with many possible answers and no definite ones .
My understanding is that it is better to say “ a gay woman ” –as a way to recognize that sexual orientation is just one aspect of any human person , and as a way to avoid drawing lines between “ us ” ( straight people ) and “ them ” ( “ the gays ” –sometimes pronounced with horror/distress ) .

It ’ s a lot less , “ Get away from my customer , you whore , ” and a lot more , “ Omg babe , you look so hot !
People love to paint women as catty bitches who can ’ t work together , but the reality is women tend to love being around other women , and this is often the case at a strip club .
Truth be told , people are just uncomfortable with the idea that a woman is comfortable and confident enough to use her body and sexuality to her advantage , so they react by putting her down , because god forbid she realize her power .
The concept that a man could allow a woman the freedom to do her job , even if it includes using her sexuality , is truly absurd to most .

How the Church Made Sex “ Dirty ” April 4 , 2017 June 4 , 2020 / biblicalgenderroles This article has been moved to my new blog dedicated exclusively to the study of sex from a Biblical perspective .
asceticism , bible , christian asceticism , church , Clement of Alexandria , dirty , sex ← Should Christian women wear leggings as pants ?
Have lots of sex , unless you BOTH agree not to for prayer for a SHORT time .
The only reason given to marry in the NT is based on attraction and sexual desire… it ’ s better to marry than to burn !
It ’ s funny because God gave us the incentive of sexual pleasure to fulfill his command to be fruitful and multiply in the earth , and we somehow try to demonize it into something bad .
Actually the pleasure side of sex is what my next article in this series will be about .
Beyond Clement of Alexandria there are many others who led the church down the road of disparaging sex .
Origen also from Alexandria , taught that in marriage procreation was the only reason to engage in the necessary evil of sex .
He did not just oppose sex he castrated himself so that he would not be tempted .
After he was converted he left his son and concubine rather than marry her and provide for his son because he was worried about the temptation of sex .
( Flesh was intended to refer to the unregenerate man but was understood by the ascetics to mean anything to do with sex ) .
Food , drink sex were all despised for a deeper spirituality .
Courtly love taught that sex in marriage was for the utility of offspring , but forbidden adulterous sex was exciting and pleasure .
It also brought back into the European psyche the veneration of women and especially her sexual desire in a similar manner as the pagan fertility cults .
In America , sex was further despised by the fundamentalist movements of the 1800 ’ s .
Condemnations of oral sex even in marriage , strong drink , cards , dancing , movies etc .
Today many young girls have been taught in church that sex is dirty and men are basically animals to be tamed by a wife .
Some think that it is their job to regulate their husband ’ s sexuality and lead him to sainthood .
It certainly doesn ’ t help that leaders like Al Mohler are telling wives that their husband must earn the marriage bed by not wanting sex too much .
God gave the gift of sex for pleasure , oneness , to grow love and to make babies , the church has made the gift of sex something that God never intended ; they have defiled the marriage bed .
We were taught that our sexual natures were for the most part evil and something to be suppressed , not something to enjoyed .
When sex was presented in any positive light – it was the female sexual nature – the romantic view of sex that was elevated .
Sex based on feelings , not pleasure was the only redeemable form of sex in their view .
This is perhaps the best article I ’ ve ever seen on this vitally important topic It literally needs to be enshrined and then mailed out to every single pastor and teacher in the Christian faith The damage that Christian asceticism has done to millions of lives is perhaps incalculable but at least with articles like this we can restore sanity to the body of Christ I was not happy with just the one quote from Clement so I added some other quotes I knew of from Justin Martyr , Augustine and John of Damascus to show the progression of the hostility toward sex in the Church over the centuries .. check out that section again to see the new quotes .
I never realised that those verses were specifically about sexual acts .
It seems some people dodge the theme of sex in it , and rather say it is about God , and the Israelites or God , and the Church .
@ BGR The added examples help to demonstrate the the antagonism of the church toward sex even in marriage was not just limited to a few leaders but was pervasive and persistent .
If God in His wisdom had not made men to desire sex so intensely no doubt the church would have depopulated the west and Europe as we know would have died out .
Ironically , it is the very sex drive that God puts in men to be fruitful and multiply that the church so rigorously condemns that preserved Europe and provided for offspring to continue the faith .
Another factor that denigrated sex and marriage was the codification of monogamy or the outlawing of polygyny .
Beauty was despised for the faux-virtue of modesty ( ie unattractive or homeliness ) and sex was thought to be a venial sin that could be avoided if one did not marry .
There was one other concern that a man must account for if he were to care for more than one wife and that is that he does not sexually deprive any of his wives and provides for all of them .
He gave to marriages the gift of sex and required that sex be as frequent as either person desired .
He made sex to be passionate , imaginative and exciting .
As an aside , men who are married , have sex with their wives and raise children are more motivated to build things and take dominion .
It is no coincidence that during the middle ages when sex was scorned as a venial sin and marriage a necessary evil , that technology and dominion stagnated .
There is a strong correlation between men receiving invigorating sex with their wives and the progress of the dominion mandate .
Without it , there is “ no marriage ” — in the sense that marriage is the only relationship set-up by God in which sex is allowed and encouraged .
Unfortunately , sex has been so perverted by our society that it is considered “ bad ” or “ not to be discussed in a pleasurable sense ” by the church even though it was created by God for pleasure and procreation .
Later it would be the Catholics and then others today like the Jonadab and I discussed who tell Christians they can ’ t go to movies , drink , play cards , enjoy sexual thoughts…ect .
He tried to use religion to demonize sex and thus exterminate populations across Europe .
Since Satan could not suppress the strong sex drive that God placed in man he decided to reverse his strategy .
In this way humans could act on their God given sexual drives ( which he could not stop ) but he could stop the natural results of sex which was the production of children .
In this way he used “ free sex ” ( sex free of the possibility of having children ) to actually accomplish his goals .
( * * here , I believe he is referring to unmarried folks * * ) { 2 } Nevertheless , to avoid fornication , let every man have his own wife , and let every woman have her own husband. ” ( * * I believe this passage identifies sex as one of the primary reasons for the gift of marriage * * ) In one of the comments , you mentioned polygamy .
On a physical level they do this by having sex which is the very act of marriage .
So for instance if a man has three wives – by the command of God in Exodus 21:10-11 he must provide each of his wives with food , clothing and sex .
Also because God only created one man and one woman that meant incest ( brother/sister ) marriage was required to begin the human race .
Fortunately , now the Roman Catholic Church teaches the “ unitive ” role of sexual intercourse that accompanies the procreative role .
This “ unitive ” application was sorely missing from previous theological debates about sex , especially in the Augustinian tradition , which tended more towards a borderline gnostic view of sex .
The idea that sex was only for procreation was so unsatisfactory .
Fortunately , sites like this an others ( even the Vatican now ) show that God had a deeper reason for sex than just the utility of child bearing .
See , supposedly it ’ s tacky to wear a big sandwich board that says “ Hi , do not touch me ” so no one there was forewarned and it was only fair that I suck it up .
The roots from Blues started from was from African music traditions , African American work songs , and negro spirituals .
As per many women , touching , pressing , and playing with their clitoris frequently gives them a sense of accomplishment .
It is not necessary , that you have to interchange the sex positions frequently .
Discovering sexual positions , lead to immense pleasure , but every time you don ’ t have to try a new posture that is difficult .
Do not focus on the adult or porn industry .
Just like your sexuality , your elasticity is your personal phenomenon .
The cozy you feel with each other , the better you enjoy sex .
Here are some of the best sex positions to satisfy each other .
The friction in the clitoris will increase female pleasure .
Moreover , the Doggy style hands the couple to stimulate the breasts and clitoris at the same time .
However , if the penetrator lies down with their penis upright the baton may even pass to them .
The lady here can rub their clitoris to increase the sensation and experience a blast of pleasure .
Both of them keep their faces towards the genitals of the other .
The man and the woman provide an oral sex session to each other sucking out each other ’ s nectar .
The people must enjoy the sex positions at the same time ; this must be the goal of every posture .
Sam has also increased the number of high-risk behaviors – drinking and engaging in sexual relations in a way that was unlike his previous history .
It ’ s clear the seed of the idea for the plot of this book came from Columbine , but according to what I gleaned from Keplinger ’ s comments during the panel , her book is more concerned with how the media covers tragedy , creates “ inspiration porn ” from survivors stories , and most importantly , how the stories of those involved in these tragedies get distorted in that lens .
On December 19 , the prosecutor in southern Giza referred eight police officers to the criminal courts on charges of raping and torturing a young man to death , while pressuring him to confess to murder and theft .
Among the defendants were the chief inspector at the Pyramids Police Department , the chief detective , three deputy detectives , and two policemen , who were together charged with raping and fatally beating the detainee .
Over the past few months , several strong voices have emerged in favor of full decriminalization of the sex trade in New York State .
The average citizen likely has no idea what it means to decriminalize the entire sex trade .
So , let us translate : it means allowing pimping , brothel-owning , and buying of sexual services to become big business in New York City , at the expense of some of the most marginalized members of our community .
As advocates for survivors of sexual violence and exploitation , we have watched with intense interest as cases of sexual harassment and assault in Hollywood , professional sports , popular music , and other industries have unfolded in daily headlines .
Like women preyed upon in Hollywood and elsewhere , the vast majority of people in prostitution are in vulnerable positions and exploited by men with power : a homeless girl coerced into the sex trade for food or housing ; a Transgender woman purchased repeatedly by violent men ; or a woman under pimp control with quotas and beatings if she doesn ’ t reach them .
In both cases of prostitution and sexual harassment , power and control are exercised by those with choices over those without .
A Hollywood executive who coerces a woman to have sex is no different than a privileged businessman buying sex .
Whether paid or not , sexual harassment and exploitation in the workplace or in a brothel cause the same damage .
Whether it is Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulting actresses wanting Hollywood careers ; R. Kelly raping teenage girls hoping for record deals ; or Robert Kraft purchasing sex from trafficked women , acts of sexual exploitation dehumanize and objectify the victims .
Similarly , when the ubiquitous phrase “ sex work ” is used to describe a system of abuse , we must remember that money can not buy consent .
A staggering percentage of survivors grapple with post-traumatic stress disorder , anxiety , depression , suicidal ideation and dissociation , having had to detach from their bodies just to stay alive like the teenager traumatized when her pimp burned a mouse alive as a warning if she tried to leave ; or sex-trafficked women consenting to their exploitation out of fear for their lives ; the undocumented immigrants working in massage parlors thrown out on the streets when they refuse buyers ; and women who try to exit the sex trade fall victim to further exploitation because they have no marketable skills , education , or sense of self-worth .
They want sexual gratification and the power to exert control .
Decriminalizing the sex industry would declare that women and girls , the LGBTQ community , people living in poverty , and people of color , are commodities to be bought and sold .
We need a legislative model shown to reduce the commercial sex market , increase safety , provide services for survivors , and hold men accountable for the crimes they commit .
It solely decriminalizes individuals who are bought and sold , while targeting sex buyers .
It ’ s time to listen to survivors and demand an end to sexual violence .
The answer is not making it legal to pimp or buy sex .
Legalizing prostitution and normalizing “ sex work ” in a time when sex trafficking is a problem not yet solved , is tone deaf at best .
I ’ m one of the sex workers who has been fighting for this .
* Some * sex buyers don ’ t care , for sure .
But many sex buyers do care !
And not all sex workers are trafficked , abused , or underage .
They also don ’ t point out that prostitution stings carried out by cops often involve them having sex with the sex workers before handcuffing them , fineing them , stealing their money , and jailing them .
” So , let us translate : it means allowing pimping , brothel-owning , and buying of sexual services to become big business in New York City , at the expense of some of the most marginalized members of our community. ” Um…no ?
“ Similarly , when the ubiquitous phrase “ sex work ” is used to describe a system of abuse , we must remember that money can not buy consent. ” This statement is just…wow .
I am a sex worker , meaning I CONSENT to the acts that my clients and I perform together .
I enthusiastically consent , I love my job and so so so so many sex workers will say the same .
Being afraid of being targeted by the state , the fact that awful clients are able to abuse/exploit me since I can ’ t go to law enforcement for help , the fact that payment platforms ( like PayPal ) are able to literally steal money I earned out of my account bc they don ’ t consider sex work real work .
These are the things that make my life ( and the lives of countless sex workers ) difficult , dangerous , precarious and often deadly .
Ashley on June 6 , 2019 at 3:34 pm said : Whenever you read an article about sex work , ask yourself these questions – was it written by a sex worker ?
did it interview current sex workers ?
are sex worker lead organizations quoted ?
This article is written by two attorneys opposing sex worker organization endorsed legislation .
It ’ s also disappointing to see how they frame the Swedish model as helpful to sex workers .
In every country it ’ s been implemented in , sex workers have reported feeling more unsafe , increased rates of violence from police and cops and increased social stigma .
Under the Nordic model sex workers are still penalized by police and community .
Anyone assumed to be a sex worker is at risk of being harassed by police .
But perhaps the most regrettable thing about this article is trying to tie victims of Weinstein to homeless sex workers .
I don ’ t think Ashely Judd and Angelina Jolie have the same level of vulnerability as a trans sex worker .
Under our current criminalization model and under the Nordic model , any sex worker who comes forward can face anything from arrest to constant police harassment to forced homeless and inability to legally rent .

Funny how sex workers in Nevada do not consider sex work “ gender-based ” violence .
This move will decrease sexual crimes period .
Some men are sitting in sexless marriages because the woman they chose to marry is withholding sex from them .
There have been many times where I was harassed or almost coerced into sex by scum that cared more about getting off then about me as a person .
I have worked in the porn industry since I was 22 years old ( I ’ m 31 ) and , as unbelievable as it sounds , I was fortunate to have a decent enough experience .
Now true , I was asked to sleep with men , women , people who were transgender , or a combination of the three for my shoots but never once did the directer ( a woman by the way ) treat me any less then a person and the people I had sex with were all professionals who had always done what they could to make things comfortable for me when I was starting out .

There are presently no publicly available guidelines on how far one ’ s transition has to go in order for a change request to be approved , but it appears from previous instances that the ICA may require a letter or certificate from the relevant doctor stating that the person has undergone full sex reassignment surgery .
That being said , it is possible for a person who has legally changed his/her sex to legally marry a person of the opposite sex in Singapore .
For example , a person who was born male may undergo sex reassignment surgery and subsequently change the sex on his IC from male to female .
It is also important to note that if a husband or wife in a legally valid marriage changes his/her sex after the marriage , then the marriage will be voided .

On Wednesday , Gillibrand will hold her first hearing as chairwoman — on sexual violence in the military .
… It made a difference in terms of holistic approach. ” For years , conversation on sexual violence in the military has been dominated by the House , where Reps. Michael R. Turner , R-Ohio , and Niki Tsongas , D-Mass. , founded the Military Sexual Assault Prevention Caucus .
Indeed , senators had been so reluctant to discuss sexual violence in the military — where the Department of Defense estimates 19,000 assaults occurred in 2011 — that when the director of “ The Invisible War ” tried to interview lawmakers in 2010 , only House members would go on camera with him , according to Greg Jacob , a former Marine and policy director at the Service Women ’ s Action Network .
Former Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta later cited the acclaimed documentary as key to his decision to implement new rules regarding sexual assault .
Witness what [ Sen. ] Claire McCaskill has had to say about having been a prosecutor and the issue of sexual assault , so I do think there is a difference. ” Indeed , McCaskill and Shaheen were among the female senators who lashed out at military leaders last week , when news broke about a decision by an Air Force general to overturn a jury ’ s guilty verdict against a military pilot accused of rape .
Gillibrand sees a direct connection between the decision to allow women in combat and future incidents of sexual violence .
“ One question that has been raised is , will that help alleviate the number of sexual assaults by having women in combat , so there would be less overall discrimination in the armed services , ” Gillibrand said .
In this context sex is a biological characteristic and gender is treated as a social role .
Women and men both can report sexual assault without law enforcement and the public passing judgement based on gender-driven assumptions .
Statistically and historically , women have an upper hand because the situations occur on an enormous basis with women , be it sexual or domestic violence , harassment , rape , eve teasing , no rights in property etc , so the sympathy factor remains , but men can be feminists too , they can support a women for all the good causes , there are very few who have no ego problems , but with awareness things could change .
After Roe v. Wade was passed , the CDC showed that “ denying women access to legal abortion does not prevent them from having abortions , but just increases the likelihood that they will resort to an illegal abortion carried out under unsafe conditions. ” It is also statistically true that abortions drop with comprehensive sex education and access to birth control and other contraceptives .
Teens are going to have sex no matter what , but if they believe that they will be punished for doing so , then they won ’ t be using contraception for fear of being discovered , and suddenly their chances of needing an abortion skyrocket .
I don ’ t think we are far apart in our belief that abortions should be rare , and safe on those occasions where they are driven by absolute necessity or it is a case of incest or rape and a hard decision is made .
Gorsuch in particular has defended Native rights and sided with the majority in determining that discrimination based on sexual and gender identity was illegal under the Civil Rights Act , and Kavanaugh joined the majority in declining to hear and possibly overturn a case that protected people on Medicaid seeking care at Planned Parenthood , helped to block the execution of a man with an intellectual disability , and even though dissented in the particular case about Title VII and discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity , nonetheless conceded that there could be cases where he would have ruled with the majority–just not in that specific one .
And HELL YES to cheap and free access to high-quality healthcare and the wide spread of comprehensive sex education !
Controlling people ’ s sex lives is one of the only things more important than reducing abortions to those folx .
Because of the taboos surrounding sex and especially pregnancy in this country , nobody really hears the thousands of stories about miscarriages , legalese , deformities , stillbirths , etc .
We don ’ t have free and accessible contraceptives to everyone who wants them and our sex education was a joke ( I was one of the ones in an abstinence only environment and had purity culture pounded into my head ) .

Caretto noted in her report that about 7 percent of preschool-age boys exhibit cross-gender behavior and that it was “ not abnormal. ” She noted that “ as children get older , they identify more consistently with their assigned sex and those who don ’ t identify with their assigned sex become more aware that expressing gender non-conforming behaviors can be met with disapproval. ” Caretto found that Katee was more accepting of Finn than Chris and that Finn sensed his father had a problem with his gender fluidity .

On the surface , SB 1441 would add “ sexual orientation ” to an anti-discrimination statute dealing with how state funds are handed out .
The bill ’ s sponsor , state Sen. Sheila James Kuehl , an openly gay legislator , claims the law will “ close an important gap in California ’ s nondiscrimination laws. ” But pro-family analysts say the law will also expand the definition of discrimination to include the perception of someone ’ s sexual orientation or even of someone “ associated with a person who has , or is perceived to have ” any of these characteristics .
“ It is spelled out in our Code of Conduct that any kind of sexual aberration could face school discipline policies , ” he told CitizenLink .
These four bills would require that in every classroom from kindergarten through high school that perverse sexual activity be praised and highlighted in a positive light .
And in functional sexuality courses from K-12 they would require positive explanation of the merits and instruction of anal intercourse .
No mention of moral aspects of sexual behavior would be permitted unless immoral activity were praised and in fact referred to as moral .
In other words the pushing of the sexual envelope would be unleashed with a nitro-fueled explosion the likes of which has never been seen in America ’ s history .

The journalist Benjamin Law started the hashtag # How I Will Change for men to publicly confess and “ take responsibility for their role in rape culture , complicit or otherwise , ” portraying any man who has ever questioned the accuracy of a claim of harassment as a “ bad guy. ” It is important to consider the accuracy and impact of stereotypes of men in general as violent .
It has also been shown that the subset of the population with the greatest propensity to criminality , those known as “ life-course persistent offenders , ” are much more likely than the general population to commit rape or engage in sexual coercion .
The researchers who have investigated this go on to suggest the tendency of this small minority of men to commit such acts may be caused by the genetics of those specific men , not by a “ rape culture ” that teaches men in general that violence against women is acceptable .
In the realm of sexual harassment as well , repeat offenders are likely to be giving the male population a bad name .
Indeed , some investigations have found that attempts to rehabilitate psychopaths ( as diagnosed by the Hare psychopathy checklist ) have actually increased their likelihood of committing violent crimes such as sexual assault .
The actress Alyssa Milano began a social media campaign to raise awareness of these forms of abuse in the world at large , tweeting to ask anyone who has been sexually harassed or assaulted to reply , “ Me too. ” While Milano may have had the admirable goal of drawing attention to a serious issue , the subsequent narrative that has been presented has not been entirely accurate , and a non-trivial amount of ugliness has also been unleashed .
To have been “ sexually harassed or assaulted ” can encompass anything from hearing a sexually explicit joke once to being brutally raped repeatedly over an extended period of time .
It also behooves us to be aware that violent crime , including sexual assault , has been in decline for decades .
According to the Rape Abuse and Incest National Network ( RAINN , ) our country ’ s largest non-profit devoted to rape prevention , sexual assault has dropped by half in the U.S. since 1993 .
While even one rape is one too many , we should also be concerned about creating a moral panic when the evidence suggests that the situation is actually improving .
By examining these data , we can evaluate the claim that sexual violence is a universal experience among women and that men are unaffected .
To begin , let us consider the most severe form of sexual violence , rape .
However , the NISVS uses a definition of rape that excludes most male victims , including only those who were either raped by another man or anally violated using the rapist ’ s fingers or an object .
Most men who were raped by a woman—whether through physical force , threats of physical force , or incapacitation from date rape drugs or alcohol—are instead listed as being “ made to penetrate , ” which is classified as a form of “ other sexual violence ” despite meeting the common definition of rape as forced sexual intercourse .
The lifetime prevalence of this form of rape is 4.8 % for men and too small a number to accurately estimate the survey results for women .
Combining these two pairs of numbers , we find that rape is approximately 3-4 times more prevalent among women than among men , depending on how many men who were “ made to penetrate ” were also victims of rape under the NISVS definition .
However , the gender gap vanishes altogether when we look at the prevalence over a 12-month period instead of lifetime prevalence : 1.1 % of women were victims of rape , while 1.1 % of men were “ made to penetrate. ” We do not know the reason for this discrepancy .
Whatever the true gender ratio , we know that rape is far from being a universal experience of either gender but nonetheless a problem for both .
The NISVS also measured other forms of unwanted sexual contact that do not rise to the level of rape .
Having discussed sexual abuse at length , let us now turn our attention to domestic violence .
We must be willing to listen to men ’ s pain along with that of women , including the perspectives of people of all sexual orientations and gender identities , and seek solutions that build a better world for all of us .

The court stated that it is patriarchal and sexist to suggest that a woman can not be believedwhen she states that she was raped , merely for the reason that she is sexually active .
In May 2013 , the apex court had held that the two-finger test violates a woman ’ s right to privacyand asked the government to provide better medical procedures to confirm sexual assault .
Invoking the International Covenant on Economic , Social , and Cultural Rights 1966and the UN Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power 1985 , the apex court said rape survivors are entitled to legal recourse that does not re-traumatise them or violate their physical or mental integrity and dignity .
After the 2013 Justice Verma Committeereport on amendments to criminal law for a faster trial , and enhanced punishment in sexual assault cases , the Union Health Ministry brought out detailed guidelines for the medical examination of victims of sexual assault in early 2014 .
The guidelines state that a rape victim ’ s consent ( or her guardian ’ s , if she is minor/mentally disabled ) is necessary for any medical examination.Even if the consent is not provided , the victim can not be denied medical treatment .

Would anyone seriously advocate , in any other circumstance , that we should permit rape , and murder , and torture , and tearing children from their families , and systematic imprisonment of the innocent to continue unabated in order to avoid war ?

Human chromosomes : Humans chromosomes are of two types autosomes and sex chromosomes .
Genetic traits that are linked to the sex of the person are passed on through the sex chromosomes .
Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells , of which 22 pairs are autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes , making a total of 46 chromosomes in each cell .
The sex chromosomes determine the sex of an individual during reproduction .
These sex chromosomes differ between the male and the females .

He also gave us His Law for how the sexuality should and should not be used .
The sexuality issues the “ Equality Act ” raises are about people trying to change how they were created , and their “ right ” under U.S. law to act in violation of God 's laws .
This is obviously not the case because ( a ) no one is checking on people 's sexual compliance with any law in their private bedrooms , and ( b ) the push remains to pass a law that has consequences for how people engage in public .
The “ Equality Act ” is about people being able to create whatever sexuality they want , act in whatever way they want on that basis , and force everyone else everywhere they go to accept their decided-upon sexuality , including people who do n't agree with those decisions , and especially those who do n't agree on the basis of their faith in God 's Word .

STI screenings are tests that play a crucial role in detecting sexually transmitted infections and diseases ( STIs & STDs ) .
It can be awkward to talk about your sex life , but it is important that you are upfront about any symptoms you may be experiencing , your health history , the number of sexual partners you have , and the type of sexual contact you have had recently .
If you are diagnosed with an STD , you should tell any sexual partners you have about the diagnosis so that they can be tested and treated - if needed .
Sexually active women under the age of 25 Women over the age of 25 with multiple sexual partners Gay or bisexual men Individuals with HIV People who have been forced to have sexual activity against their will Pregnant women should be tested early in the pregnancy because an STD infection can lead to low birth weight , premature labor , or result in a miscarriage .
Chlamydia and gonorrhea tests are simple forms of testing used to detect the presence of these sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) .
Both of these diseases are caused by a bacterial infection spread through oral , vaginal , or anal sex .
However , in other cases , symptoms include : Common symptoms of gonorrhea in men include : Off-color discharge from the penis Common symptoms in women include : Bleeding between menstrual periods or after sexual intercourse Pain in the lower abdomen or pelvis White or yellowish vaginal discharge In addition to infecting the genitals , gonorrhea can infect the rectum , the eyes , and the throat .
These include : Increased risk of HIV/ AIDS Heart and brain damage Common symptoms of chlamydia include : Clear or white discharge from the vagina or penis Burning pain during urination Itching or burning sensations around the vagina in women Bleeding between menstrual periods and after intercourse in women In addition to the sex organs , chlamydia can infect the rectum which may cause rectal bleeding , pain , and discharge .
The CDC recommends that sexually active women under the age of 25 receive yearly tests for both of these infections .
Other individuals who are at an increased risk of infection - and who should receive yearly testing - include : - Men who have sex with men - Men or women who have multiple sexual partners - Men or women who engage in unprotected sex - Men or women who have previously been diagnosed with an STD - Men or women who have had a sex partner previously diagnosed with an STD - Men or women who have been diagnosed with HIV/ AIDS How is a chlamydia/ gonorrhea test performed ?
Women undergoing a test for chlamydia will have a cell sample taken from their vagina with a cotton swab or brush .
Syphilis is a bacterial infection that is spread through anal , oral , and vaginal sex .
An infected individual spreads the Treponema pallidum bacterium , which enters the body through the vagina , anus , or mouth .
The first sign of infection is usually a small sore that appears on the genitals or mouth called a chancre .
A chancre is usually painless and may be undetectable if it appears in the anus or vagina .
Risk factors for contracting syphilis include : Unprotected sex ( not using a condom ) Sex with multiple partners Are infected with other sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS How do doctors test for syphilis ?

This week alone , in this case and in the definition of sex in the 1964 Civil Rights Act case , this Court has continued its leftward march .
Some quick legal background : Like many states , Massachusetts has a legal mechanism to keep people in jail who have been convicted of sex offenses , even after they ’ ve served their sentences , if it considers those people to be sexually dangerous .
In almost all cases , this statute allows prosecutors to bring a petition before a court when a convict is about to complete his or her sentence for a Massachusetts sex offense , and argue that the person should be civilly committed at the completion of his or her sentence , because that person remains a sexually dangerous person and poses a continuing threat of harm to others .
Basically , when prosecutors file such a petition , they ’ re saying “ Yes , this person served his sentence , but he ’ s still sexually dangerous , and shouldn ’ t be allowed on the streets .
Convicts that have been judicially declared to be criminally insane , and sexually dangerous persons , are held there .
A voyeur is someone who likes to watch others sexually .
A flasher is someone who wants to be watched sexually .
The defendant in this case , named Donald Suave , has been convicted of the Massachusetts sex crime of “ open and gross lewdness ” seven times , almost always flashing young adult women , sometimes even masturbating in the process .
The court said no , but drew a very narrow line , emphasizing the importance of the words “ contact sex crime ” in the interpretation of the civil commitment statute .
Clarifying that if the defendant had done this while stalking someone , or engaged in this behavior in front of child , their ruling would have been different , the court ruled that “ The Commonwealth must show the defendant ’ s predicted sexual offenses will instill in his victims a reasonable apprehension of being subjected to a contact sex crime .
That ’ s so because while emphasizing that its ruling was restricted to this defendant and this particular case only , Spina also wrote that the ruling should not be interpreted to mean that sex offenders who have committed only noncontact crimes such as flashing do not pose a threat of harm to others .
“ We can easily envision a case where the outcome might be different , based on the specific behavior of a particular defendant. ” Uh-huh… Now that that ’ s clear… Regardless of this somewhat mixed ruling , as a Boston , Massachusetts sex crimes lawyer , I think it ’ s clear that this ruling will not protect offenders who have physically harmed , or posed the threat of harm to , others – and that ’ s obviously a good thing .
But it ’ s also my opinion that this ruling will make it harder for prosecutors to civilly commit some sex offenders – those who aren ’ t very likely to commit bodily harm against another .

Saniyya Sidney is a very appealing child actress with a lot of spunk .
Many of her features that followed , including the serial killer story I Can ’ t Sleep , the coming-of-age drama Nenette and Boni and the French Legionnaire saga Beau Travail , are filled with rapturous images and scenes of a very sensual nature — even though Denis actually finds that she has a “ rather prude ” approach to sex in her films .
“ It ’ s the erotism present in daily life , in the way we eat meals or go about our chores , that interests me most , ” she said , citing the Japanese auteur Yasujiro Ozu as a major influence in that respect , especially on a film like 2008 ’ s 35 Shots of Rum .
Regarding High Life , which premiered at the Toronto Film Festival last month and screened for French audiences for the first time in Lyon , Denis agrees that there is a more overtly sexual side to the film .
“ I definitely thought about sex a little… To paraphrase Marguerite Duras , if you don ’ t think about it when making a film , then you won ’ t make a good film. ” Indeed , High Life contains scenes where a young woman is drugged and raped , where a scientist ( played by Juliette Binoche ) walks around cupping semen in her hands and where characters use a space-age masturbation device called the “ fuckbox , ” making it perhaps the most carnal movie Denis has ever shot .

Other Child Sex Abuse Exonerations from Utah David Hawkins ( Photo : Leah Hogsten/The Salt Lake Tribune ) In November 2006 , 45-year-old David Hawkins was charged with sexually assaulting two of his sons , ages 9 and 13 , in Salt Lake County , Utah .
On October 18 , 2007 , the jury convicted Hawkins of two counts of sodomy to a child and one count of aggravated abuse of a child .
He pled guilty to two counts of sexual abuse of a child and was sentenced to two consecutive terms of one to 15 years in prison .
On March 3 , 2015 , Hawkins was released from prison on parole and required to register as a sex offender .

Plainly put : shit happens .
Here ’ s the thing : people are actually pretty awesome , and 99.9 % of them have absolutely zero desire to rob , rape , or murder you .
The “ shit happens ” attitude that the poster of this article has towards hitchhiking is totally out of line , and unacceptable .
Or if you do , you do so with a male friend who is aware of the dangers – date rape drugs , etc .
As for my own experiences while occasionally hitchhiking back in the early to mid-1970 ’ s , when I was already in my 20 ’ s , there were a couple of weird experiences I had , when the men who picked me up started out with perfectly innocuous , normal conversation , which disintegrated into sexual innuendoes and over/undertones , which I felt had the potential for developing into something more sinister .
Those who try to whitewash the subject with phrases like “ You ’ re more likely to be sexually assaulted or killed by a family member or an acquaintance. ” , or “ The household I grew up in is more dangerous than being on the road. ” , or “ It ’ s like crossing the street ; one only has to look , and to be aware. ” are completely and totally missing an extremely important point : That while most people are perfectly normal and honest , the chancea of being picked up by , or even picking up somebody who ’ s not that normal and honest is still there .
When their talk slid into sexual innuendoes and undertones , however , I excused myself and asked the person ( s ) who ’ d given me a ride to let me out , which , fortunately , they did .

During those years I have seen SNAP as the best hope for survivors of clergy and religious leader sexual abuse to find and then use their protest voices in a supportive environment of peers and professional helpers .
I have seen it metaphorically as the flagship of the sexual violence advocacy community .
The SNAP community was a rich international environment of support and activism on behalf of sexual abuse survivors .
SNAP was beginning to find , it seemed to me , a way to address religious-cultural differences , skin color differences , and even linguistic differences in the clergy abuse sexual survivors ' community .
In August , 2015 , SNAP formally welcomed a group of twelve Mennonite and Mennonite-related sexual violence survivors and activists into its community .
When collective rage and interpersonal hostility drive individuals or entire groups of individuals to exit the sexual violence advocacy organization , the torpedo has found its target .
While an enraged desire for gaining control is understandable in the wake of sexual violence and abuse , it is my opinion that it is extraordinarily misguided behavior inside social activist movements of the collective .

Well , that sucks for the one host who gets that mutation , but because they die so quickly they can ’ t pass it on .
If a vaccine prevents that host from experiencing the deadly symptoms , the host can go on living , strutting around the yard and pecking at ticks and laying eggs and doing whatever else chickens do while quietly incubating the extra shitty new mutation .
And since the vaccine is “ leaky , ” that host can now go on to spread the extra shitty new mutation to other chickens .

Treats Sexual Dysfunction Some sources indicate that ginkgo may treat sexual dysfunction , such as erectile dysfunction or low libido .
As a result , ginkgo may also be useful for treating various symptoms of sexual dysfunction by improving blood flow to those areas of the body .
Some research has investigated using ginkgo to treat sexual dysfunction caused by the use of antidepressant drugs ( SSRIs ) .
One study evaluated the use of ginkgo to increase sexual desire and contentment in women who were concurrently undergoing sexual psychotherapy ( 27Trusted Source ) .
The rationale for using ginkgo to treat sexual dysfunction makes sense , but research does not support it at this time .
Ginkgo may improve symptoms of sexual dysfunction due to its impact on blood flow .

However traditional human trafficking has been described as the abduction or kidnapping workers with the intent to enslave ; usually women and girls destined to work in the commercial sex industry ( U.S. Department of State , 2005 ) .
However over the years recent developments have implemented a much broader definition for human trafficking , which addresses both working conditions and how a person is recruited and treated , considering human trafficking to be one of the most serious of crimes which violate the human rights of those who are exploited where the global value of sex is placed on women and labour placed on men ( European Parliment , 2016 ) .
Nevertheless the United Nations stated that “ Trafficking suggests the recruitment , transportation , purchase , sale , transfer , harbouring , or receipt of persons : by threat , use of violence , abduction , use of force , fraud , deception , or coercion ( including abuse of authority or of a position of vulnerability ) , or of the giving or receiving of payments benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another or debt bondage , for the purpose of exploitation which includes prostitution or for placing or holding such person , whether for pay or not , in forced labour or slavery-like practices in a community other than the one in which such person lived at the time of the original act described ” ( UNODC , 2016 p.14 ) .
Human trafficking in Pakistan In Pakistan , the biggest human trafficking problems are bonded labour and prostitution and in some cases trafficking of organs , which involves people of any gender or age , but predominantly those trafficked are women and children as the global value placed on women is sex and sexuality and for men it is considered as labour ( Rahman , 2011 ) .
It is indicated that those who enter forced labour in Pakistan are usually from Afghanistan , Bangladesh , and Sri Lanka , and where women and girls are used for sex trafficking often come from Afghanistan , China , Russia , Nepal , Iran , Bangladesh , Uzbekistan , and Azerbaijan , it is also indicated that refugees from Afghanistan , Bangladesh , and Burma , as well as religious and ethnic minorities such as Christians and Hazaras , mostly women and children and is both cross border and internal ( U.S. Department of State , 2016 ) .
This demonstrates that as a result of Pakistan ’ s colonization the country instigates poverty and for the purpose of economic gains , which in turn leads to the human trafficking and sexual exploitation of innocent people , mainly involving women and children ( Alaleeli , 2015 ) .
Trafficking and sexual exploitation of women , young girls and children is on the rise with traffickers in Pakistan often recruiting and transporting victims from countries like Afghanistan , Bangladesh , Burma , Nigeria , Somalia and even from its own country ( National Crime Agency , 2014 ) .
Victims from Pakistan are often escorted to places like Australia , Europe , Turkey and South Africa by bribing public officials , facilitating the transportation , gathering information , receiving victims at the destination and exploiting them , physically beating , sexually assaulting , psychologically traumatising , and economically depriving them to create a reliance on themselves as traffickers ( Human Rights Watch Avenue , 2000 ) .
“ Moreover , the false job offers especially for girls and women in United Arab Emirates and high recruitment fee charged by illegal labour agents or sub-agents of licensed Pakistani overseas employment promoters entrap Pakistanis into sex trafficking and bonded labour ” ( U.S. Department of State , 2014 ) .
Of the investigations for abduction and illicit intercourse , it is unclear how many of these were related to sex trafficking .
However in March 2016 the government made efforts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts by making arrests in brothels both on those employed and their employees including victims of sex trafficking .

Modern literature is absolutely flooded with the ‘ reminiscences , ’ ‘ diaries , ’ ‘ journals , ’ ‘ correspondence , ’ & c. , of great and little poets , orators , and statesmen , and no one now thinks of reprehending a system which threatens to put an end to all friendly confidence and to all social and familiar intercourse in literary society .

The goal instead is to vaccinate women of childbearing age and their sexual partners — because Zika also can be transmitted through sex — well before pregnancy ever occurs .
Volunteers given different amounts of Zika would be kept in a Hopkins hospital unit for 12 days , to be sure the virus had cleared the bloodstream , and would have to agree to use condoms for a while afterward to avoid any possibility of sexual transmission .
The extra benefit : Tracking people from the moment they 're exposed to Zika also could shed important new light on how the virus affects the body — such as how long it 's infectious in blood , semen and other bodily fluids , and just how the immune system fights it off .
It is clear it is a political ideology with a religious motif , whose aim is global domination .

This is not the typical length of a rape investigation ; indeed , it is an extraordinarily long time to investigate a rape accusation .
Not every rape investigation involves DNA evidence , and DNA does not necessarily prove that a rape occurred at all , anyway ( as DNA evidence could also indicate a consensual sexual encounter ) .

Speaker to discuss child sex abuse prevention Tara Walker Lyons , an advocate for the prevention of childhood sexual abuse , will be the guest speaker Friday at the meeting of the Grandparents Protection Society .
Lyons has worked with state lawmakers to address the need for education in schools to teach children about body safety and sexual abuse prevention .
Steve Bullock in April signed “ Tara ’ s Law , ” which provides public schools on educating children and educators on how to address childhood sexual abuse .

Sexual Harassment – Protect Your Company and Employees Employers can not afford to ignore the problem of sexual harassment .
The New York Times maintains a list of men who have been fired , forced to resign or faced other consequences as a result of sexual harassment allegations .
When sexual harassment occurs , it hurts both the target of the harassment and the company .
Victims of sexual harassment may feel hurt , angry or afraid .
A Professional Environment The EEOC defines sexual harassment as “ Unwelcome sexual advances , requests for sexual favors , and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual 's employment , unreasonably interferes with an individual 's work performance , or creates an intimidating , hostile , or offensive work environment. ” Sexual harassment can include unwanted touching , pressure to go on a date or discussion of sexual topics , even when done in a casual or joking manner .
Every employer needs a written policy on sexual harassment .
The policy should include a clear definition of what qualifies as sexual harassment , with examples .
The policy should also explicitly prohibit all forms of sexual harassment .
Although having a written policy is a good start , companies may need to provide sexual harassment training as well .
For example , California law states that supervisors at companies with 50 or more employees must receive sexual harassment training .
It ’ s important to remember , however , that sexual harassment does not always come from supervisors .
All companies want to avoid the next sexual harassment scandal , but not all will .
I realized that Darcelle ’ s also gave them a space where they could indulge in some homoerotic fantasy with no risk of the actual costs of lesbian or queer identity .
They could safely engage in the fantasy of stuffing bills in a performer ’ s bra with none of the risk or stigma of actual same sex sexuality since they knew these were “ really men. ” They could exert the capitalist power of heteropatriarchy by pretending drag queens were other women without risking the lesbian label or imagining how they might feel if strangers wanted to shove dollar bills in their cleavage .
We have managed to dilute some of the stigma of same sex love and attraction , and so now heterosexuals can use our space to engage in physicality with one another without fear of being labeled “ lesbian. ” In fact , right by the stage two women were so physically engaged with one another that I thought , “ Oh , perhaps we do have a queer couple getting married , ” ( since we did at last win that right just two years ago today . )
However , it seems that users consciously can not contribute too much substantive help to “ resisting ” the full domination of mobile phones .
He did not believe in conversions and often remarked that with Vipassana , the only conversion that takes place is from misery to happiness , from bondage to liberation .

I found this great nude that Pablo painted and had to do a composition around it .

So instead of an ultra-right clusterfuck we get a meandering center-right opinion that 's largely groundless both legally and from a policy perspective .

So yes : the bottom line is that it sucks to be New Haven .

( This excerpt has been electronically transcribed - check the full report for accuracy ) The inhabitants of New Holland , in their original condition , have been described by travelers as the most degraded of the human race ; but it is to be feared that intercourse with Europeans has cast over their original debasement a yet deeper shade of wretchedness .
And again , in his charge , `` It is an awful , it is even an appalling consideration , that , after an intercourse of nearly half a century with a christian people , these hapless human beings continue to this day in their original benighted and degraded state .
`` The evil , '' said Mr. Coates , '' resulting from immoral intercourse between the Europeans and the Aborigines , is so enormous that it appears to my mind a moral obligation on the local government to take any practicable measures in order to put an end to it . ''
The commissioners acknowledge that it is `` a melancholy fact , which admits of no dispute , and which can not be too deeply deplored , that the native tribes of Australia have hitherto been exposed to injustice and cruelty in their intercourse with Europeans ; '' and they lay down certain regulations to remedy these evils in the proposed settlement .
This also reduces the risk of developing prostate problems , anal tumours and testicular cancer .

The men also wore cane piercings in one or both nipples and in their lower lips .
The men have one nipple pierced from one side to the other ; there are some who have both .
The women do a lot of work.4 This physical description is consistent with later recorded descriptions of the Karankawa , as noted in the previous section , including their size , the men having cane piercings through their lip and nipples , and their use of bows and arrows .
Discussing them further , Cabeza de Vaca relates their manner of dress : the men went nude , the women wore coverings of moss , and the girls wore deer skins .
Furthermore , there are places in Chapters 14 and 15 where Cabeza de Vaca explicitly states that he is referring to a broader population of natives , such as when he writes , `` All of the people in this country go nude '' 6 and `` This custom prevails from the island to more than fifty leagues inland .

New Judgment : Re an application by the NIHRC for Judicial Review ( NI ) [ 2018 ] UKSC 27 This appeal considered whether the Offences against the Person Act 1861 , ss 58 and 59 and the Criminal Justice Act ( NI ) 1945 , s 25 are incompatible with the ECHR , arts 3 , 8 and 14 in failing to provide an exception to the prohibition on the termination of pregnancy in Northern Ireland in cases of serious malformation of the unborn child/foetus or pregnancy as a result of rape or incest .
A majority of the Supreme Court held that the current law in Northern Ireland is disproportionate and incompatible with ECHR , art 8 insofar as it prohibits abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality , and pregnancy as a result of rape or incest , though only a minority considered that the law is incompatible with art 3 .

Fortunately for the Americans , however , the Japanese began to run out of kamikaze aircraft soon after the US forces had entered Lingayen Gulf and Oldendorf had warned Kinkaid that his escort carriers could take the burden only a short while longer as they carried close-support aircraft rather than modern interceptor fighters .

In my previous blog about Metsu I talked about certain iconography in the painting entitled Woman Reading a Letter , and was rather scornful with regards the supposed sexual connotation of the abandoned shoe which was prominently depicted lying on the floor .
In my next two featured paintings there is more iconography that has a supposed sexual nuance .
Maybe not for the Dutch word for bird is vogel and in the seventeenth century the word was synonymous with “ phallus ” and the Dutch word vogelen , which literally means “ to bird ” , was slang for “ to have sexual intercourse with ” .
So when we look at the two paintings we should look at the offer of a bird not as a gift of food but an enticement to have sexual intercourse !
He lies slumped against the end of a bench , clay pipe in his lap lying loosely against his genitals which could be interpreted as the drunken state he is in has made him temporarily impotent .
Now that we know about the bird/vogelen/sexual intercourse implications then we are now also aware what the man maybe “ hunting ” for .
Here again we have the abandoned shoe or slipper and although I was sceptical in my last blog as to its sexual meaning I am starting to believe that it has a symbolic sexual connotation .
So is the woman , because of the abandoned slipper , to be looked upon as a sexually permissive female .
Part 1 – Early life and The Letter A Hunter Getting Dressed after Bathing by Gabriel Metsu ( c.1654 ) In A Hunter Getting Dressed after Bathing ( above ) , Gabriel Metsu depicted himself as a nobleman and hunter , but of course the unusual twist to the depiction was the fact that he depicted himself in an a full-length , un-idealized , naturalistic nude pose .

President Trump is mentioned by name briefly in the latest FBI document , which notes that the origins of QAnon is the conspiratorial belief that “ Q , ” allegedly a government official , “ posts classified information online to reveal a covert effort , led by President Trump , to dismantle a conspiracy involving ‘ deep state ’ actors and global elites allegedly engaged in an international child sex trafficking ring. ” This recent intelligence bulletin comes as the FBI is facing pressure to explain who it considers an extremist , and how the government prosecutes domestic terrorists .

All of this has to do with sex : abortion , birth control , condoms , same sex marriage , women bishops , priests , deacons and shunting religion to the private sphere and out of the public and political square .
The sex abuse crisis has given them what they think is the Church 's Achilles heal and they have exploited it in a pit bull fashion .
Cardinal Ratzinger turned the cart over on that clericalism as he has on sex abuse clericalism .
This has led to children , teenagers and adults being sexually and otherwise abused and the crisis we now experience today in terms of Catholic credibility .
The politics of same sex marriage has turned ugly .
Those Christians and others who belong to other world religions that acknowledge that marriage is between one man and one woman and thus beneficial for the well being of society , the rearing of children and the stability of cultures , are being marginalized as bigots and being opposed to basic human rights , the right to marry whomever one wants even if they are of the same sex .
Those who want religion out of politics , law and legislation say that religious beliefs about marriage and the nature of sex is a private matter that should not be brought to the public square or shape judicial and legislative processes and laws .
In some places , just saying out loud that two homosexual persons should not be allowed to marry and that homosexual sex is a sin could be classified as `` hate '' speech resulting in a fine or jail time .
We do not love our children any less if they masturbate , fornicate or use pornography .
The key here is chaste , no sex .
So how do we as Catholics uphold our Catholic teachings on sex and marriage ?
We teach chastity , meaning no sexual , genital contact of any nature before marriage .
This precludes masturbation , the use of pornography , heavy petting , and the like .
We also teach that married couples ( man and woman ) must remain chaste after marriage , which means fidelity to one 's spouse in thought and deed.It means that every sexual act in marriage must be open to the transmission of life although the Church teaches that married people may plan their families naturally , not in a disordered way .
Sexual intercourse must be natural and as God intended , i.e .
the procreative aspect of sexual intercourse which by nature occurs between a man and woman .
Thus acts that are not natural or disordered would include masturbation , oral and anal sex not to mention bestiality .
Within natural or `` not disordered '' sex , any mechanical device , pill , surgery or act that eliminates the pro-creative aspect of sex as God intended it ( natural law ) would be illicit , immoral and disordered .
Natural law also allows for the pleasurable aspect of heterosexual sex , the two aspects of sexual intercourse are parts of natural law between a husband and wife .
The Church and thus all Catholics have a mandate to hand on the teachings of the Church in the areas of sex and marriage and to have a voice in the public debate about marriage and laws surrounding it .
Because of original sin , we are all born `` disordered '' including our sexual appetites .
Some sexual acts are inherently disordered , other sexual acts are natural and of God , in particular procreative and unitive sex between one husband and one wife which is a permanent commitment .
Finally , I recognize that many reading this are freaking out since the official teachings of the Church are difficult , especially in the area of sexuality where hormones sometimes control the mind rather than the intellect .
Sometimes full consent of the will in giving into temptation is compromised by hormonal activity and so-called physical needs.These sexual urges could be understood as a part of our fallen and thus `` disordered '' humanity .
In other words , Catholic sexual morality and the teaching on marriage is not meant to make the sinner who seeks God , His mercy and His grace , neurotic , scrupulous and anxiety and depression ridden .
If one is to obsess on any aspect of Church teaching in the area of sexuality , obsess on mercy and forgiveness .
The action in itself bad ( the sexual relationship with a partner who is not the legitimate spouse ) does not become subjectively good due to circumstances .
This does not obscure the truth that the relationship more uxorio with a person of the other sex , who is not the legitimate spouse before God , constitutes a serious fault against chastity and justice due to one ’ s spouse .
The media , both news and entertainment , both owned by the same people , had and have an agenda to discredit the Catholic Church because she teaches immutable divine truths at odds with the so called Hollywood culture which supports the radical left 's political agenda that wants to neuter or change the Catholic Church because of the divine truths of sexuality , sanctity of life and the true nature of marriage among others that Holy Mother , Church teaches .
We are all disordered to a lesser or greater degree in terms of our entire being to include sexuality .

In many families , but not mine , the topic of sex is taboo .
It ’ s not appropriate for a family to discuss sex .
The next phase is being able to actually discuss sex between teenage children and parents .
The ability to communicate clearly the moral views of the parents – and teenagers – as well as the ability to be open about the challenges and risks of having sex as a teenager have changed .
Currently in the French capital for a run of shows in that quintessentially Parisian cabaret , the Crazy Horse , the diva of glam sex recounts how a teenage passion for underwear propelled her rise to celebrity , both as stripped-down `` Queen of Burlesque '' , and dressed-up fashion icon .
`` When people think of being beautiful or sexy , it 's important to remember that those things are different for everyone , '' she said .
Burlesque was like early 20th century song-and-dance vaudeville , but more risque , with more skits on sex and stripteasers as the stars -- such as her heroine Gypsy Rose Lee .

“ I hurt you and for that I ’ m truly sorry , ” Thorne tweeted , addressing the sex workers who use the platform , and who felt her actions threatened their ability to continue doing so .
“ I wanted to bring attention to the site , the more people on the site the more likely of a chance to normalize the stigmas. ” In response to allegations that she charged customers for nude photos she did not intend to deliver , the New York Post reports that the offer may have come from a third-party that merely purported to be Thorne ’ s account , though the details remain unclear .
“ On that call , I advised her team to consult with sex workers and address the way she went about this as to NOT hurt the sex work industry .
“ She doesn ’ t know anything about the true struggle of being a sex worker , ” says Kel , one person who was creating content on OnlyFans before Thorne arrived .
Thorne allegedly sent out a message that promised fully nude photos of herself to users willing to pay $ 200 to open the file .
But , in practice , the platform ’ s primary users , and the ones with whom the OnlyFans brand is most associated , are sex workers .
Particularly amid the pandemic , when in-person sex work has become more dangerous and jobs in many industries have simply dried up , a flood of adult content creators have found a way to ply their trades from wherever they are in the world .
“ I think one of the key differences between how Cardi B and Bella Thorne talk about sex work is that Cardi B is an advocate and an ally for sex workers .
“ I also feel like Cardi B didn ’ t abandon us when she got famous , which is something I appreciate more than she will ever know. ” By contrast , Madison says , Thorne ’ s arrival on the platform felt like a dilettante “ dabbling in sex work while ignoring the plight of sex workers , ” and exploiting an audience built by professionals who put themselves at risk .
“ In reality , sex workers are marginalized , vulnerable workers who could really benefit from celebrities using their platforms to advocate for full decriminalization of the sex industry , which is what would keep us most safe from the harms associated with doing sex work. ” Critics say the problem is compounded by the perception that much of the work to build the platform ’ s prominence was done , in particular , by BIPOC sex workers , and Thorne , a white woman , was cashing in without acknowledging the labor of those individuals .
What ’ s the connective material between your life and your life inside the world of OnlyFans ? ” Thorne cloaking her dalliance in the online sex work space with the “ acceptability ” of an actress researching a role sits poorly with OnlyFans creator Savannah Solo .
“ If she wants to hop on OnlyFans and sell some implied nudity , be my guest , ” Solo says .
“ The media doesn ’ t like to report on actual sex workers reaching success , because they don ’ t want to promote it as a valid line of work. ” Madison is among the creators who have made a full-time living from the site but , amid the post-Thorne changes to its payment structure , wonders if she ’ ll be able to continue to do so .
“ I used to work as an escort for many years , and then I left the sex industry to pursue mainstream employment , ” she says .
“ And now Bella Thorne ’ s behavior has pushed me out of another. ” Another worry confronting OnlyFans creators is the concern that , as more mainstream celebrities and members of the general public join the platform–some perhaps inspired by Thorne ’ s success–the prices they can set for virtual sex work will eventually drop due to a saturation of supply , perhaps to the point where it ’ s no longer a viable source of income .
And the very sex workers who are credited with building OnlyFans up may be the ones with the most to lose .

I 'm not actually in * favor * of such bullshit , but if were talking about 'the impact of a life-changing decision ' , it seems to me having a child is the largest life-changing decision a person could ever make .

Utilized for a tightening of the vagina , the vaginoplasty is an extremely popular but seldom discussed form of plastic surgery .
Vaginoplasty Procedure The process of vaginoplasty is simple and straightforward , requiring that the plastic surgeon make small incisions and simply reshape the vagina so that it is slightly tighter and more attractive overall .

“ The sexual assault on Emily Doe was entirely preventable if the Defendants had fulfilled their duty to repair a known defective condition , ” said Dunn .
“ The Defendants knew that the exterior door did not close properly but they turned a blind eye and did nothing about it , thereby putting their residents at serious risk. ” “ Shockingly , when I visited the apartment building two years after the rape , the door had still not been repaired and I was able to open it easily , ” said Kelly .
“ Even knowing that a rape had occurred in the building did not spur the Defendants to make the easy but necessary repair. ” Emily Doe endured physical injuries including bruises and lacerations as a result of the sexual assault and strangulation .

Why are so many coming out now and claiming they were sexually assaulted ?
Harvey Weinstein ’ s history of sexually preying on actresses , journalists , and musicians — and then scaring them into silence — has led to a deeply national soul-searching of how and why this can happen , why it goes unreported for so many years , and what can be done to stem the tide of seemingly an increase in sexual harassment cases at a time when people are supposed to be more enlightened and sensitive to sexual harassment .
How can it happen given that most organizations have required sexual harassment training ?
We ’ re hearing about the need for sexual harassment training in all workplaces – Hollywood , Congress , and so on .
The reason is the type of men who sexually harass women do so out of a sense of power and influence over their careers and/or advancement to a higher or better-paying job .
So , it ’ s all about the ability and willingness of a man to use his position to garner sexual favors .
Does anyone really believe Bill Cosby or Harvey Weinstein would not have sexually harassed so many women had they gone through sexual harassment training ?
In my view , all they do is explain what is and is not sexual harassment .
Second , many organizations conduct sexual harassment training online .
In my first sexual harassment training program , I started by having a woman volunteer ( set up in advance ) sit at a desk , doing her work , while a man came up from behind her .

The prohibitions in the Torah ( the first five books of the Hebrew Bible that comprise the Written Law in Judaism ) states the following in the general , English translations : “ Do not lie with a male as one lies with a woman ; it is an abhorrence ” ( Leviticus 18:22 , JPS translation ) “ If a man lies with a male as one lies with a woman , the two of them have done an abhorrent thing ; they shall be put to death — their bloodguilt is upon them ” ( Leviticus 20:13 , JPS translation ) The verses ( emphasis added ) state literally that only male-male sexual intercourse is forbidden ; the Torah says nothing about female-female sexual acts .

Nobody likes it when guys talk about how they 'll always be a virgin , or how nobody loves them or their life sucks .
While some may disagree with the ethics of this , something that might help : Define one weekend as `` social experiment weekend '' , and tell yourself you 're going to talk to cute girls and not give a rat 's ass if they reject you , because you do n't even know them enough to be interested in their personality ANYWAY , so who cares .

“ Take a Tic Tac and grab ’ em by the pussy is the closest thing to a plan Donald Trump has described this entire election. ” [ Image credit : Full Frontal with Samantha Bee ] Daughter # 1 , Amanda Taub , writes a column called The Interpreter for the New York Times ( along with her writing partner , Max Fisher ) .
In yesterday ’ s column Special Tax on Women : Trump Tape Is a Reminder of the Cost of Harassment , she wrote : The leaked footage of Donald J. Trump boasting of sexually harassing and assaulting women is just one particularly notable example of an all-too-common phenomenon : Far too many men treat women ’ s bodies as if they are fair game for anyone who happens to encounter them .
The burden of avoiding and enduring sexual harassment and assault results , over time , in lost opportunities and less favorable outcomes for girls and women .
Sometimes that cost is the pain and humiliation felt by the women who men directly grope , kiss and harass .

Filmmaker Lizzie Borden to talk sex , feminism at ‘ Working Girls ’ screening in S.F .
Photo : Janus Films The 4K restoration of “ Working Girls ” might be one of the key film events of 2021 , as it is basically a rescue of a nearly lost 1986 feminist film about sex workers that was one of Miramax ’ s early successes .
” ‘ Working Girls ’ had shown at the Roxie years ago , and some of the sex workers I had done a panel with way back when will be there , ” Borden said .
It ’ s going to be cool. ” “ Working Girls ” takes a radical approach : Set during the course of a day at a Manhattan brothel , it looks at sex work as a job — one part of a patriarchal economic system , to be sure , but one in which women were in control .
There ’ s sex , all right , but it ’ s hardly titillating .
“ When it came out , it was important because it was shocking for the public to see prostitution and sex workers portrayed in a way that doesn ’ t judge and stigmatize them , ” said Carol Leigh , a.k.a .
“ It ’ s really about the fact that sex in this country then and now is different from what this culture sells .
“ Still there ’ s this sexual impulse .
… People dated and had sex during the pandemic , which was a little bit scary .
But sex is sex , and some sex workers I know worked during the pandemic , because strip clubs were closed and they took a lot of chances. ” Molly ( Louise Smith ) entertains a client in “ Working Girls ” ( 1986 ) .
… And there was a lot of nudity in theater pieces .
I remember one show where Willem Dafoe and Kate Valk did a show with hula skirts on and nothing underneath. ” Borden , whose only other feature was the 1992 thriller “ Love Crimes , ” which starred Sean Young and Patrick Bergin , also worked in television , directing episodes for ’ 90s erotic series “ Silk Stalkings ” and “ Red Shoe Diaries , ” among others .
Now she ’ s working on a film about a female abortionist battling misogyny in McCarthy-era America that would act as the completion of a thematic trilogy after “ Born in Flames ” and “ Working Girls. ” She also started editing an anthology of writings by strippers and sex workers that will act as a frontline report on sex work during the internet era , including the pandemic .
“ That ’ s changing the idea of sex work .
I think it is good because sex work isn ’ t going to go away. ” “ Working Girls ” : Lizzie Borden in conversation with Carol Leigh at 7 p.m. Friday , July 9 .

Thou shall not lie with mankind as with womankind… By carnal knowledge of them , and carnal copulation with them , and mixing bodies in like manner : this is the sin commonly called sodomy , from the inhabitants of Sodom , greatly addicted to it , for which their city was destroyed by fire : those that are guilty of this sin , are , by the apostle , called `` abusers of themselves with mankind '' , ( 1 Corinthians 6:9 ) A law against unnatural lusts , sodomy and bestiality , sins not to be named nor thought of without the utmost abhorrence imaginable , v. 22 , 23 It can not be any clearer than that unless one is an atheist who believes nothing .
One example that comes to mind is sexual imorality .
God specificly states in the Bible to stay sexually pure .
7- Homosexual sex is condemned in the bible , but so is a lot of other stuff that Christians don ’ t seem eager to mention ( see Deuteronomy and Leviticus ) .
The GOP sure hasn ’ t curtailed same sex unions ( not necessarily ‘ marriages ’ ) either .

The Board of Censors , while appreciating the need for authenticity , allowed them to dance topless but insisted on the tribal dancers wearing pairs of specially made black knickers .

A spokesperson for the shopping center told BBC News that , “ the right thing to do ” was not to extend Chik-fil-A ’ s lease after the “ six-month pilot period. ” The spokesperson continued : “ We always look to introduce new concepts for our customers , however , we have decided on this occasion that the right thing to do is to only allow Chick-Fil-A to trade with us for the initial six-month pilot period , and not to extend the lease any further. ” Chik-fil-A ’ s notable history for advocating against the interests of the LGBTQ community is old news in the states at this point ; the company ’ s chairman caused a bit of controversy back in 2012 after coming out against same sex marriage .
In 2013 Chik-fil-A ’ s anti-LGBTQ donations “ doubled , ” and in 2011 the chain donated $ 3 million to an anti-same sex marriage organization .

It was just too depressing listening to these folks reinforce each other 's self-deprecatory `` I ’ m-just-not-good-enough '' bullshit .
And as for you ( pointing to the heckler ) , you can go shit in your hat ! ''
I do n't give a shit what it takes .
`` The golden years suck ! ''
I was a unsuspecting victim of sexual assault while serving in the US military .
I have reached out to local rape crisis centers over the years for confidential support in my efforts to figure out what was happening to me and learn new ways to cope .
I wanted to suck it up and move on , never to speak of the incidents again .
I am appreciative to our hotlines and local rape crisis centers who help us work through the aftermath of these crimes .
I know how hard it is to recover after you find yourself a victim of sexual assault .
It made me happy to see so many gathered together to promote sexual assault awareness .
I support the agencies who help victims of sexual assault with all my heart after having witnessed what they have done for me .
Jim : Our game B world , we talk about that first experience where you start to see through the matrix and you realize that this world that ’ s been presented to you in which so many people just follow their nose through life day-to-day , well guess what people , it ’ s kind of manufactured bullshit .
So we ’ re seeing all this actually filter from the lowest parts of our independent relationships , all the way up to the presidency of the United States , to Supreme court hearings with Brett Kavanaugh , to the pass that Joe Biden is going to get on his accusations about rape and sexual assault , to the way things are being handled on college campuses , and the philosophies and instruction that are being put into our children ’ s heads .
And I think I was well ahead of the curve , frankly , particularly in corporate America , hired women in all kinds of nontraditional jobs , because I said , I don ’ t really give a shit if you ’ re a man or a woman , if you ’ re happen to be interested in being an assembly language programmer , and you ’ re female , and I actually did hire such in 1986 , you got the job .
Jack : And as soon as you speak up , you ’ re just a racist , misogynistic asshole , and you can be discarded and thrown to the wayside .
If that happens , just put your head between your legs and kiss your ass goodbye .
And one of the things I pushed back on him , he ’ s now actually is agreeing with me , I said , “ Hanzi , you estimated that 25 % of people in modern societies like Sweden or the United States are postmodernists , and I ’ d say horse shit , I think it ’ s more like 1 % .
I find that , you mentioned The Matrix earlier , I find , that in order to shake people from those thought patterns , and that thought model , it takes a crisis , it takes something external to them , it takes like a big fucking club over the head , where it gives them a moment to reconsider .
And then , someone questions you and you get angry and you ’ re like that guy ’ s an asshole .
Jack : And I ’ m sad to report now that those same people that ousted me from that school in 2015 , 2016 , they ran that school into the fucking ground and the thing got closed .
Because you can accept that there are differences , there are innate differences , biological differences , psychological differences , differences in outcomes without all of the sudden taking some great leap into supremacy and oppression and eugenics and shit .
The implicit-association test is bullshit , I have to say that .
And the IAT , if you want to do the research it ’ s out there , and I suggest looking up Jesse Singal , he ’ s a leftist journalist who has dogged down super deep on this and revealed the implicit-association test to be a bunch of shit .
He just was able to suss out the fact that that test does not have any scientific merit , in the same way that whatever study that they did to say that there ’ s like one in four women on campus gets raped or sexually assaulted , that too completely bunked .
However , that test , just like the implicit-association test , that survey became the foundation for the 2011 Dear Colleague letter that modified Title IX which then corrupted our entire academic system and put off men in the cross hairs and called everybody a rapist .
At the same time as the Democrats seem to be spiraling farther and farther away from me to the left into this very , very ultraprogressive social justice shit which isn ’ t based on any sense of liberty at all .
I don ’ t need to support them because that was achieved. ” And in fact , now they have stopped being the advocates for liberty and advocates for this injustice and this bullshit way of distributing prestige and merit and resources among people who claim to be victims and have created a whole new victim culture , and who had abandoned any notions of due process and justice for boys and men on our college campus , which thank God was just remedied just yesterday by Betsy DeVos in the education Department of Education .
Jack : The country has gotten drunk and fallen down and they ’ re in the alley and I ’ m still standing there like , “ What the fuck are they doing ? ” And so now that Donald Trump ’ s on stage with a rainbow flag , and he ’ s been very clear on his position on cannabis legalization , that opened the door for me to consider other things .
That seems like an absolutely fucking no-brainer to me .
Jack : No , Joe Biden is the one that believed in the rape culture who did the 2011 dear colleague letter that took away do justice and due process and liberty from boys across the country , who prohibited accusers of being cross-examined , who threw away evidence-based decision-making .
Come on , get the fuck out of here with that .
Racism getting worse every single day , misogyny getting worse every single day. ” All of them , they can ’ t even say , “ I ’ m going to pick the best candidate for vice-president. ” They all have to come out and say , “ I ’ m going to pick a woman ” because she ’ s a woman because she ’ s got magic ideas because she has boobs .
And you admit the fact that Trump is a bit of a prime fucking asshole , right ?
I mean , how could somebody say to the shit that the man says , right ?
Now , does he lie and twist and exaggerate and be all hyperbolic and shit ?
I ’ m tired of people whining about shit on social media .
I ’ m at once a product of all of the shit that ’ s going on and I feel like I ’ m working on a solution to everything that ’ s going on .
Because despite the criticisms that you ’ ve elicited from me , despite the shit talking that I ’ ve done in this episode , I am generally very focused on how to move forward positively in a constructive manner that is good for me , my family , my community and my nation .
In sexuality , lubricants , lubricating gels or even lubricating creams are a useful means of reducing friction on the mucous membranes .
The use of a lubricant gel can be wonderfully integrated into foreplay and used to massage your partner 's genitals .
Due to the moisture of the lubricant , penetration of the male genitals can take place without pain .
It 's best to put some on your finger and spread it on your penis and on or in your vagina , depending on where you want to use the lubricant .
A sex toy can also be rubbed with a water-based lubricant to ensure smooth fun .
But important : When using a condom , do not lubricate the penis beforehand , otherwise the condom may slip off unintentionally .
Even semen can trigger allergic reactions .
Hormone imbalances : The sensitive environment of the vulva is particularly vulnerable when hormonal changes such as menopause or periods are present .

SACRAMENTO – State officials have established a new grant program to provide funds for cities and counties to help conduct audits of their untested sexual assault evidence kits , California Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced Tuesday .
The Untested Sexual Assault Evidence Grants are intended to assist agencies to achieve the goal of determining the number of untested sexual assault evidence kits throughout California .
In September , Governor Jerry Brown signed AB 3118 by Assemblymember David Chiu ( D-San Francisco ) , which requires every law enforcement agency , medical facility , crime laboratory , and other specified facilities , to conduct an audit of all untested sexual assault evidence kits in their possession and report to the California Department of Justice no later than July 1 , 2019 .
Earlier this year , DOJ was allocated $ 1 million through the state budget for grants available to cities and counties to count the number of untested sexual assault evidence kits in their possession .

Gay conversion therapy is a bullshit religious practice in which people who hate gay people utilize various “ techniques ” with no basis in science in an attempt to convince a gay person to not be gay anymore .
As you might guess from their names and the fact that I ’ m telling you all of this , Bryan Simonaire is Meagan Simonaire ’ s father — the one who tried to get her into religious therapy to convert her sexuality .
Meagan Simonaire had never discussed her sexuality in public prior to that speech , but she said she spoke up in order to prevent more LGBTQ people from experiencing the shame that she did .
We have all the evidence that clearly shows that gay conversion doesn ’ t work as promised and it only ends up hurting both the people involved and the larger gay community as a whole , since it leads to further stigmatization and the characterization of sexuality as a disease that should be cured .

Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte is an advance in global political history because he is against the total domination of the bourgeois , here in the form of a parliamentary republic , which ended universal suffrage and which dominated in many ways more thoroughly than in absolute autocracy as Marx himself said .
Thus Napoleon was one of the very first of many “ foreigners ” ( he was born shortly after France took control of the island , and thus was truly French ) to seek domination not by France but by the ideals of the French Revolution .
Moreover , things were now beginning to move against the Grand Army ; they were no longer possessed of sufficient numerical superiority , and Napoleon was now too far from home to use the Imperial Guard , his last reserve , to snatch a victory .

Lena Dunham Just Summed Up the Biggest Problem With How We Talk About Rape in America It 's problematic how we talk about rape .
From questioning the victims to questioning the very definition of `` rape '' itself , skepticism continues to permeate the discussion about rape in America .
Lena Dunham powerfully addresses this in an essay at BuzzFeed that explains why she chose to speak out about her rape in her memoir , Not That Kind of Girl .
In one pointed sentence , she encapsulates everything wrong with our current discourse : '' There is no right way to survive rape , and there is no right way to be a victim . ''
The takeaway : Women should not be judged for how they decide to process their rape , and they especially should not be criticized for speaking out about it through their artistic endeavors ( as Dunham has done both through memoir and also through her hit show Girls ) .
While we 're slowly beginning to think differently about rape culture in this country , ignorance colors our conversations , especially when it comes to the `` right '' way to deal with sexual assault .
From the media to the courtroom , survivors are interrogated about their experiences before the rape , during the rape and after the rape .
There is no right way to survive rape , and there is no right way to be a victim .
As she writes , `` Speaking out about the realities and complexities of sexual assault is how we begin to protect each other .
I do not want our daughters born into a world that reacts to sexual violence against women in this way . ''

Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women , probe finds [ VIDEO ] An investigation into Democratic New York Gov .
Andrew Cuomo found that he sexually harassed multiple current and former state government employees , state Attorney General Letitia James announced Tuesday .
Cuomo sexually harassed current and former state employees in violation of federal and state laws , ” James said at a press conference on Tuesday .
Cuomo faced multiple allegations last winter that he inappropriately touched and sexually harassed women who worked with him or who he met at public events .
Boylan has said those records “ were leaked to the media in an effort to smear me. ” The governor has repeatedly argued that he did not intend to harass anyone Other aides have said that the Democratic governor asked them unwelcome personal questions about sex and dating .
One former aide , Charlotte Bennett , said Cuomo asked if she was open to sex with an older man .
Others suffered through repeated offensive , sexually suggestive , or gender-based comments , ” Kim said Tuesday .
New York state regulations say sexual harassment includes unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature — from unwanted flirtation to sexual jokes — that creates an offensive work environment , regardless of a perpetrator ’ s intent .
His office has said he took the state ’ s mandated sexual harassment training , but has not provided any documentation proving he did .
Cuomo championed a landmark 2019 state law that made it easier for sexual harassment victims to prove their case in court .
Alleged victims no longer have to meet the high bar of proving sexual harassment is “ severe and pervasive . ”

Early Intervention in Psychiatry 2014 ; 8 : 12-12 Toxoplasmosis can be a sexually transmitted infection with serious clinical consequences .
Here we present a hypothesis suggesting that toxoplasmosis is transmitted from infected men to non- infected women during unprotected sexual intercourse , which can result in the most serious form of disease , congenital toxoplasmosis .
In some species infec- tion of females by artificial insemination with semen from infected males has been observed .
( 3 ) Prevalence of toxoplasmosis in women in child-bearing age covaries with the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases in particular countries .
This second peak of infection could be associated with women having regular unprotected sex after marriage .
This trend could be a result of decrease in promiscuity and increase in safe sex practices , both associated with the AIDS pandemics .
( 7 ) In women , probability of being Toxoplasma - infected correlates positively with the amount of unprotected sex with the child ’ s father before the con- ception .
Evidence against the hypothesis : Questionnaire study showed negative association between Tox- oplasma infection and the number of earlier partners with whom the woman had unprotected sex .
If our hypothesis turns out to be true , then sexual route of transmission , even if rare , could be responsible for a large part of cases of congenital toxoplasmosis .
Women should be warned that having unprotected sex with men of positive or unknown toxoplasmosis status should be avoided during pregnancy .

Publisher 's Description : In this collection of new reflections on the sexual politics , racial history , and moral predicaments of anthropology , feminist scholars explore a wide range of visions of identity and difference .
Some selections explore how sexual politics help to determine what gets written and what is valued in the anthropological canon .
Their subjects range widely : the writings of feminist Filipinas ; Thai stories of widow ghosts ; eye-witness accounts of a beheading ; narratives of bewitching genitals , recalcitrant husbands , and market women as femmes fatales .

Together these essays represent the state of the art in research and writing about the development of modern consumption practices , gender roles , and the sexual division of labor in both the United States and Europe.Covering a period of two centuries , the essays range from Marie Antoinette 's Paris to the burgeoning cosmetics culture of mid-century America .

Lawrence Kramer traces today 's sexual identities to their nineteenth-century sources , drawing on the music , literature , and thought of the period to show how normal identity both promotes and rationalizes violence against women.To make his case , Kramer uses operatic lovedeaths , Beethoven 's `` Kreutzer Sonata '' and the Tolstoy novella named after it ; the writings of Walt Whitman and Alfred Lord Tennyson , psychoanalysis , and the logic of dreams .
At the same time , he imagines alternatives that could allow gender to be freed from the existing system of polarities that inevitably promote sexual violence.Kramer 's writing avoids the conventional dress of intellectual authority and moves between music and literature in a style that is both intimate and effective .

Verse 27 , “ In the same way , the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another , men with men , committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error ” – which is , of course , a reference to any sexual disease , including AIDS , that is the built-in penalty for that kind of behavior – but here ’ s homosexuality .
You can tell when the wrath of God is revealed on a society that has turned its back on the truth and suppressed the truth , because the first step is a sexual revolution , and the second step is a homosexual revolution .
First comes the sexual revolution , then the homosexual revolution , and then comes the depraved mind , the reprobate mind .
Now , you ’ re in trouble when you plunge into sexual immorality .
There are some key people that the enemy used , like Hugh Heffner , to bring in the sexual revolution .

People With Intellectual Disabilities Are Vulnerable To Sexual Assault , Many Ca n't Speak To Report Many people with intellectual disabilities ca n't talk or have difficulty speaking — and are unable to report when they 've been raped or sexually assaulted .
Ted S. Warren/AP hide caption Editor 's note : This report includes graphic and disturbing descriptions of sexual assault .
So the alleged rape was discovered , according to the police report , only by accident — when a staff worker said she walked into the woman 's room and saw her boss with his pants down .
Shepard , the longtime supervisor in the building , denied that he 'd had sex with the disabled woman .
Police wanted a DNA sample for testing ; Shepard said , according to the documents that charged him in court , that he had already given his DNA sample `` in regard to a previous sexual assault allegation 2 to 3 years ago . ''
For Some With Intellectual Disabilities , Ending Abuse Starts With Sex Ed NPR investigated sexual assaults against people with intellectual disabilities .
We found that they are some of the easiest and most frequent victims of sexual assault .
Maryann is the woman who was the victim of the alleged rape on that November morning .
NPR does not use the last names of survivors of sexual assault , unless they prefer their full name be used .
Shear advised me that Shepard had the client 's legs pinned up to her chest and that he was making back and forth movements like he was having sex .
... Shear told me that she saw Shepard 's erect penis come out from between the client 's legs when he turned around ... '' Police arrested Shepard for suspected rape and took him to the station .
He `` denied all allegations of sexual contact '' with the disabled woman .
She then tracked down Maryann at the hospital , where she had been taken to be examined for rape .
McIvor remembers the woman telling her , `` I do n't know why they 've left him on the hall ; he 's had a prior sexual allegation . ''
From another sexual assault allegation two or three years ago .
Washington state officials , with the Department of Social and Health Services , said they ca n't talk about the alleged rape of McIvor 's sister because it 's a pending legal matter .
But Lisa Copeland , a spokeswoman for the department , said that in the earlier rape allegation , several male staffers — including Shepard — were asked to submit DNA samples .
The day after Shepard was charged with the rape of Maryann , the Washington state agency in charge of regulating state institutions — the Division of Residential Care Services — sent a team of investigators to the Rainier School .
The report describes the alleged rape that night of Maryann and how she was taken to the hospital for a rape exam , although it does n't use her name .
Shepard was charged with rape of Maryann and for taking `` indecent liberties '' with the second woman who came forward .
We asked how often these state agencies got reports of suspected sexual abuse of someone with an intellectual disability .
Cases where a suspected rape was uncovered only because of some unexpected proof .
It angers McIvor that a staff person is charged with raping her sister .

It is more than conceivable that being prone to these problems could make people engage in more risky behaviour ( in fact I can point you to some articles on this ) , including substance abuse , promiscuity and not using sexual protection , and therefore the link here could just be that people with mental health problems and substance abuse are more prone to unwanted pregnancies ( which is just as plausable in my mind .
It is quite evident from the above that our groups are defined by i ) the presence or absence of abortion , but crucially also ii ) the desire to terminate their child ( and the multitude of complex variables tied up in that little nugget ) .
Having had itching ears ( due to the sexual revolution ) and soaked up this misinformation , we have filtered this mindset down through several generations , who now can not see anything wrong with it – in theory !
For example , masturbation-turns-you-mad rhetoric was and is obvious nonsense ( which does n't negate * moral * objections to the act of course ) , and even the Catechism of the Catholic Church curiously does n't invoke psychology as an ideological framework that would condemn masturbation ( http : //www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2352.htm ) Would you agree that many people in the pro-choice side do , in good conscience , believe the foetus to just be a clump of cells ?

Another thing that makes want to take a break or even permanently break up is that a friend told me that he was playing a “ dumb boys game ” in which they had scenarios and could pick any girl they knew , and that in the “ having sex ” , he picked the one girl I ’ m jealous of and insecure that they do more than talk .
She has told me she sees him as an older brother , but now that he said he ’ d have sex with her… it ’ s weird .

The ZeroNow Campaign gets Canada ’ s party leaders on the record about where they stand on gender-based harm and sexual harassment .
During nationally broadcast debates in the last federal election , the terms “ sexual harassment , ” “ sexual misconduct ” and “ sexual violence , ” or anything related to those subjects , were neither raised nor commented on by any party leader .
Women across Canada tell us that gender-based harm and sexual harassment in the workplace remain inadequately addressed at the top , leaving too many women at risk every day .
Over the past several months , toxic workplace conduct has seen a governor general resign in disgrace , a former chief of Canada ’ s defense staff charged with obstruction of justice in connection with sexual harassment accusations , the removal from command or criminal charging of other general officers , and legal settlements in the military and RCMP amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars .
As a nationally recognized voice in combating gender-based violence , The ZeroNow Campaign is determined to ensure the subject of sexual violence and sexual harassment in the workplace is given the attention it deserves by party leaders during this election .

I learned that the head of the penis was intended to be an internal organ and that removal of the skin around it would force the head of the penis to adapt as an external organ .
That the foreskin was there to protect the head of the penis - keeping it safe , warm and clean , while also increasing sexual pleasure in both partners .
So , knowing this ( and knowing how obsessed we are with sexual pleasure and `` bigger penises '' ) , I had to wonder where this came from .
Sex is/was seen as `` dirty '' and circumcision was said to help prevent sexual deviance and masturbation by taking away from the sensitivity of the penis ( which it does ) .
When it became obvious that sexual deviance and masturbation did n't seem to have a preference between cut and uncut men - the reason then was that it was simply `` cleaner '' to circumcise .
I have a very hard time believing that the answer to our STD issue is cutting skin off of the penis as a preventative measure , but that 's a whole other article .

Rape – Criminal Sexual Conduct ( CSC ) Defense Lawyer in Charleston , SC Rape , or criminal sexual conduct ( CSC ) , charges are serious allegations that can destroy a person ’ s life , family , and reputation .
It is a “ hot ” political issue , with competing arguments on both sides – victim ’ s advocates say that police and prosecutors do not believe rape victims often enough , and that rape victims are demonized and dragged through the mud when they make their allegation .
On the other hand , many , many rape allegations are false , and people who have been accused of rape suffer irreversible reputational damage , in addition to incarceration and the expense of defending against false allegations .
Boyfriend or spouse : Someone has casual sex during a night out .
What happens when a white girl has sex with a black man , and the girl ’ s racist family finds out or is about to find out ?
Revenge : Boyfriend breaks up with girl , and the next day she calls the police and reports that he raped her – he is now arrested , jailed , and branded as a rapist which will surely dampen his future romantic prospects… Mental illness : Many false allegations of rape involve some form of mental illness on the part of the accuser .
Alcohol or other drugs : If a guy takes advantage of a girl who is severely intoxicated to the point that she can not consent to sex , that is CSC 3rd degree under SC ’ s rape laws .
But , what happens if both are severely intoxicated and have consensual sex ?
Should only the male be charged with rape when neither are legally capable of consent ?
It is also a fact that many rape allegations are false , and that people are arrested every day and charged with rape when they did not commit the crime .
A prosecutor or victim ’ s advocate ’ s refrain is that evil defense attorneys “ blame the victim ” in rape cases .
If the rape allegations are false , the defendant is the victim .
If a mentally ill , drunk , remorseful , mutually drunk , or revenge-seeking person makes a false allegation of rape , the defense attorney ’ s job is to show the reasons why the person is making the allegations – that is not “ blaming the victim , ” it is showing why the “ victim ” is not a victim at all to avoid further tragedy .
SC has what is called a rape-shield statute , SC Code Section 16-3-659.1 , that prevents the defense from introducing evidence at trial of an alleged victim ’ s unrelated sexual conduct solely for the purpose of attacking their character and credibility .
The rape shield statute does not , however , prevent the defense from introducing evidence that shows that the alleged victim is lying and why the alleged victim lied .
In every case , the defendant ’ s right to present a complete defense takes precedence over the rape shield statute or any other legislation that would prevent the defendant from presenting their case when the evidence is relevant and admissible – in some cases , even when it involves prior sexual conduct of an alleged victim .
In many rape cases , we will need to retain an investigator to help us determine the alleged victim ’ s motivation for lying , whether they have made false allegations in the past , whether mental health issues exist that may explain the alleged victim ’ s behavior , and to locate and interview witnesses favorable to the defense .
In some cases , we will need to retain expert witnesses like a doctor who can review and explain the results of a rape kit , crime scene analysts , or experts who can review the state ’ s forensic evidence and testify at trial when needed .
Rape charges can be first , second , or third degree , depending on how the rape was accomplished and the amount of force used .
CSC Third Degree 3rd-degree CSC involves the use of non-aggravated force or coercion or sexual conduct with an alleged victim who is incapacitated due to intoxication , mental capacity , or other reasons .
Besides the life-long stigma of a rape conviction , criminal sexual conduct convictions may result in : Long prison sentences ; Lifetime registration on the sex offender registry ; Lifetime GPS monitoring for some offenses ; Loss of employment ; and Inability to find new employment – no one wants to hire a convicted ( or even accused ) rapist and subject themselves to liability .

A rapid increase in the control of fertility , and the understanding and treatment of sexual health issues , has been accompanied by an emerging threat to reproductive function linked to increasing environmental pollution and dramatic changes in lifestyle .

Many proponents of same sex marriage would have the public believe that Loving v. Virginia was the first case in which the US Supreme Court had to decide whether or not personal beliefs on the issue of sexual freedom and marriage could be regulated by the States .
In 1890 , just twelve years after the passage of the 14th Amendment , proponents argued that an Amendment to the Constitution granted US citizens the freedom to define marriage according to their own personal sexual beliefs and practices .
The Court in Davis v. Beason , 133 US 333 , 343 ( 1890 ) ( “ Beason ” ) responded to the notion of the redefinition of marriage based on sexual freedom by stating : “ There have been sects which denied as a part of their religious tenets that there should be any marriage tie , and advocated promiscuous intercourse of the sexes as prompted by the passions of its members .
The Supreme Court in Beason recognized that men could , and , if allowed , would use anything , including religion to justify “ promiscuous intercourse of the sexes. ” Now , those seeking to redefine marriage and to advocate “ promiscuous intercourse of the sexes , ” attempt to rely on the Equal Protection clause afforded by the 14thAmendment to the US Constitution , as expressed in Loving v. Virginia , 388 U.S. 1 ( 1967 ) ( “ Loving ” ) .
Loving made all laws unconstitutional which sought to prohibit marriage based solely on “ invidious racial discriminations. ” Those arguing before the US Supreme Court to redefine marriage and to advocate “ promiscuous intercourse of the sexes , ” would simply have the Court to substitute the word “ racial ” for “ homophobic ” in the Loving decision .
But to equate race with sexuality would require the assumption that race and sexuality have ever been afforded the same protection or proscriptions in law , society , or nature .
On the other hand , homosexuality has long been equated with sodomy , polygamy , and adultery .
Neither the 1stAmendment nor the 14th Amendment should be used to redefine marriage and to advocate “ promiscuous intercourse of the sexes. ” Even today , in states which have legalized same-sex marriages , there are laws that prohibit certain redefinitions of marriage based on the philosophy espoused in Beason .
So if words are to be substituted in connection with a Supreme Court case to determine this country ’ s stance on marriage , then the term “ sodomy ” should replace the term “ polygamy ” in Beason .
If we read Beason in light of the term “ sodomy ” substituted for the term “ polygamy ” , and we afford the same value to the 14th Amendment as to the 1st Amendment , the issue of equal protection of same sex marriages under the US Constitution has already been decided as follows : It was never intended or supposed that the amendment could be invoked as a protection against legislation for the punishment of acts inimical to the peace , good order and morals of society .
The cuts were subtle , and I didn ’ t really notice any of the cuts until I thought back and remembered “ oh yeah , there was some kind of toilet / sex joke in that scene before , wasn ’ t there ? ” This edit all around comes together very nicely , and it looks gorgeous on Blu-Ray to boot .

Nicholas Hunt/Getty Images Six months after accusations of sexual assault and harassment brought the downfall of Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein , the company he co-founded filed for bankruptcy , releasing victims from nondisclosure agreements that prevented them from speaking about the producer ’ s alleged crimes .

It has been variously proposed that it began as a religious sacrifice as a rite of passage marking a boy 's entrance into adulthood as a form of sympathetic magic to ensure virility or fertility as a means of reducing sexual pleasure as an aid to hygiene where regular bathing was impractical as a means of marking those of higher social status as a means of humiliating enemies and slaves by symbolic castration as a means of differentiating a circumcising group from their non-circumcising neighbors as a means of discouraging masturbation or other socially proscribed sexual behaviors as a means of increasing a man 's attractiveness to women as a demonstration of one 's ability to endure pain as a male counterpart to menstruation or the breaking of the hymen to copy the rare natural occurrence of a missing foreskin of an important leader as a way to repel demonesses as a display of disgust of the smegma produced by the foreskin Removing the foreskin can prevent or treat a medical condition known as phimosis .
Circumcision for Health Circumcision first began to be advocated as a means of prophylaxis in 1855 , primarily as a means of preventing the transmission of sexually transmitted infections .
Hutchinson 's study suggested that circumcision acted as a effective means against contracting sexually transmitted disease .
He thought the procedure ameliorated such problems based on a `` reflex neurosis '' theory of disease , which held that excessive stimulation of the genitals was a disturbance to the equilibrium of the nervous system and a cause of systemic problems .
There are fears that there is a heightened risk of spreading human immunodeficiency virus as the surgeons use the same blade and encourage boys to have sex with women after the ceremony .
The man chosen to cut the child inserts a small piece of bamboo under the foreskin , says a spell on the razor , spits a fine spray of ginger juice on the boy 's penis to anesthetize it , and with a smooth stroke cuts the top of the foreskin .
After the incision the boy 's penis is wrapped in a leaf , and a burning ember is placed on the ground between his feet to heat the wound and facilitate the drying process .
Subincision of the penis is a traditional ritual mutilation unique to the Aborigines , the indigenous people of Australia .
The mutilation is a urethrotomy in which the undersurface of the penis is incised and the urethra slit open lengthwise .
In later ceremonies , repeated throughout adult life , the subincised penis is used as a site for ritual bloodletting .
There also exists a ritual of penis holding which occurs when a subincised man enters a strange camp .
But the fact that it is done on the penis suggests that a connection with puberty can not be far away : it would make puberty seem to come under human control .
Because it is done before the penis grows , the skin pulls back , giving an appearance similar to true circumcision .

‘ Brooklyn Nine-Nine ’ Recap : Policing the Patriarchy Jake and Amy 's investigation of a sexual assault claim folds a surprisingly sensitive take on the # MeToo movement into the show 's usual antics Jake ( Andy Samberg ) and Amy ( Melissa Fumero ) investigate a sexual assault in `` He Said , She Said , '' this week 's 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine . '
This time , the topic is # MeToo , as Jake and Amy ‘ s investigation of a sexual assault charge at an investment bank turns into a larger discussion of institutionalized sexism and whether a woman is better off fighting for other women or simply trying to protect herself in a world that ’ s stacked against her .
At the beginning of the series , there were overtones of sexual harassment in Amy and Rosa ’ s primary work relationships with , respectively , Jake and Charles .
And one of the earliest and most beloved running gags between Jake and Amy was him taking her comments out of context as “ Title of your sex tape. ” It ’ s always a cleverly-phrased joke , but she hates it before they become a couple , and sometimes after , in a way she doesn ’ t most of their other competitive banter .

The original grant proposal included the following description : Through an examination of queer uses of space within the built environment , we will explore how sexuality divides cities and how urban spaces are implicated in the division of queer communities around race , gender , and class .
Using GIS mapping to visual document these sites of transgression in historical time and space , the project will identify patters of sexual segregation , analyze how these reflect , reinforce and reproduce other axes of division , and ask what we can learn about the possibilities of resistance in the urban landscape .
The final product – an interactive map available to the public via a digital portal – will allow a board audience access to the social uses of space in postwar ( 1945 – 1992 ) St. Louis , using artifacts and archival materials as well as information about historical context to bring alive the experience of living in a city divided by sexual identity and practice , gender , race , and socioeconomic status .

The legislation was introduced in the summer of 2007 , weeks after a government-commissioned report concluded sexual abuse was widespread in Aboriginal communities .
The policy also bans pornography and alcohol in Aboriginal communities and gives the government control of Aboriginal lands .
Supporters say the policy is necessary because Aboriginal communities are rife with drug addition , domestic violence , sexual abuse , illiteracy and child malnutrition .
combines with low self-esteem , boredom , cultural anomie and lack of education to produce the toxic levels of sexual abuse now seen in the bush . ''

You losers can go back to your circle-jerk forums and soft cock subreddits and make each other “ feel better ” as much as you like .
I can see right through you and you ’ re barely worth the time to say shut the fuck up .
So all they get from me is shut the fuck up !
My blanket response : Shut the fuck up you worthless scum .
You are the ones who grope and assault women in bars and don ’ t see anything wrong with it .
Just shut the fuck up and get out of my life .
“ Hmmmm , well the definition of that word is blah which means that you said this and therefore there isn ’ t a problem. ” Shut the fuck up !
Grow a spine or shut the fuck up .
Why are you so fucking insecure that nobody can make a point without it being about you ?
Get it together or shut the fuck up .
I get that this is your modus operandi for women : making rape threats , making death threats , threatening their privacy and their family .
For fuck ’ s sake , I ’ ve had Stormfront , actual Nazis pissed off at me , discussing how they were going to get me on their White Power forums .
“ Men ’ s rights activists ” are a sad fucking joke .
Men ’ s rights activists can shut the fuck up because everything about them is worthless .
There are a lot of people who make very eloquent arguments as to why MRA shit stains are wrong so there ’ s no point in me re-writing those points .

One in three women you know has been sexually assaulted .
If you need to negate someone ’ s actual experiences because of your feelings you are utterly reprehensible and need to shut the fuck up .
And for those worthless losers who can ’ t stop with their obsession of saying not all men do it and think that is in any way a meaningful contribution , here are some home truths : Statistically , it is almost certain that you work with , associate with or are related to a rapist There ’ s no doubt at all that you or someone you hang out with is responsible for abusive or threatening behavior towards a woman that made her legitimately fear for her safety And quite honestly , the more you protest , the more I suspect that you are the sort of scumbag that does these things on a regular basis .
She only knows for sure if a man is a rapist when she makes herself vulnerable and so up until that point , the man both is and is not a rapist .
And I truly believe men are hurting themselves with this “ not all men ” MRA bullshit .
The hook was Tracey Emin ’ s reaction : “ This is the biggest load of bullshit I ’ ve ever heard in my life. ” Just like real crits in art school , a lot of which is aspiring artists trying to pass off bullshit , and older artists eating it up or seeing through it .

So , whatever the medium used , if you can ’ t tell if the art sucks or not , you can ’ t tell if it ’ s great or not .
That editing was choppy , the stunts were n't really stunts , and it all lacked the ability ( at least for me ) to suck you into the action .
Beliefs about gender and sex are constructed in the state of the world according to the degree of existential security .
As existential security decreases , religiosity increases , and beliefs about gender and sex fall in line with traditional church/mosque doctrines .
As existential security increases , beliefs about sex and gender secularize .
If we take populations from areas of high religiosity and thus low existential security and displace them into a secular environment ( for example , Muslim migrants from Morocco into Spain ) , cognitive dissonance and the host country ’ s insistence that the migrant ’ s traditional beliefs about human sexuality and gender are “ backwards ” can force the migrant to coalesce with other migrants and hold onto their beliefs ( see Festinger , 1956 ) .
In other words , their traditional beliefs about sex and gender will self-reinforce due to an initial culture shock and the host country ’ s subsequent backlash against migration .
I freely admit this is going to be difficult , and furthermore , due to the effect of cognitive dissonance , it could take several generations to secularize beliefs about gender and sex .
It ’ s an erotic contemporary romance set in Floridaabout a perfumer whose formula for her masterpiece fragrance is stolen .

Rock ‘ n ’ roll was traditionally used to describe an up-and-down movement experienced aboard an ocean-going ship , it was used to describe a rollicking , song-filled ceremony encountered in black churches , and it was used to describe a movement experienced during sexual intercourse .

KRAKÒW , Poland – A former top aide to Pope John Paul II has been cleared by the Vatican of charges that he mishandled sex abuse cases in Poland , with a papal investigation concluding that his actions were “ correct ” and , as a result , “ the Holy See decided not to proceed further. ” Cardinal Stanisław Dziwisz served as John Paul II ’ s priest-secretary and , later , as Archbishop of Krakow between 2005 and 2016 .
Szymik then asked Father Tadeusz Isakowicz-Zaleski , a priest known for helping victims of church sexual abuse , to try to intervene on a higher level in the Archdiocese of Krakow .
“ I talked to Bagnasco and told him about all my doubts about the actions of Dziwisz in connection with his explanation of sexual abuse by priests , ” Isakowicz-Zaleski told the Polish website Onet on Friday , April 22 .
When Dziwisz was Archbishop of Krakow , seven cases of sexual abuse were reported and proceeded on his watch , including the case of an alleged victim known as “ Adam. ” “ I waited for 20 years to report my case to church authorities , and , to be honest , when I was going to meet the cardinal after sending him an initial letter , I thought the case would be swept under the carpet , ” Adam said .

FRIDAY , May 8 , 2020 ( HealthDay News ) -- A testosterone-lowering drug can reduce male pedophiles ' risk of sexually abusing children , according to a new Swedish study .
Treatment with degarelix reduced high sexual desire and sexual attraction to children -- two major risk factors for committing child sexual abuse .
Many of the men who received the drug said they developed an inner calm , that thoughts of sex were no longer dominant , and that they lost their sexual interest in children .
About 1 in 10 girls and 1 in 20 boys are sexually abused , primarily by male pedophiles , according to the Swedish team , though statistics have been reported higher in the United States .
They said there is an urgent need for effective and scientifically proven treatments for people at risk of committing child sexual abuse .
The American Academy of Family Physicians outlines the signs of childhood sexual abuse .
For example , a child with a history of sexual abuse could interpret touch as a sexual advance .

At least 15 women — including `` Westworld '' actress Evan Rachel Wood — have publicly accused Manson of sexual assault .
He is currently facing three lawsuits from women who claim to have been sexually abused by him in the past , including his ex-girlfriend Ashley Morgan Smithline and `` Game Of Thrones '' actress Esme Bianco .
The women claimed to have endured `` sexual assault , psychological abuse , and/or various forms of coercion , violence , and intimidation '' at the hands of Manson .
Manson 's attorney Howard King said in a statement : `` Mr. Warner vehemently denies any and all claims of sexual assault or abuse of anyone .

I was a guest on Bill Murray ’ s podcast , talking about my recovery from child sexual abuse , and how that led to a plethora of mental health issues for most of my life .
Among other things , Nikki advocates on her web site for better regulation of the modeling industry ( she tells me about 40 % of models have an eating disorder and that there ’ s a lot of sexual abuse/harassment ) .
Nikki says , “ I wholeheartedly believe that full recovery is possible , but it starts with speaking out and reducing the shame and stigma that is so often attached to mental health issues. ” In her upcoming memoir , “ Washed Away : From Darkness to Light , ” due out later this year , Nikki details how being sexually abused as a child led to a seventeen-year battle with serious mental health issues such as eating disorders , depression , self-harm , body dysmorphic disorder , substance abuse and sexual addictions .
During her career as a professional model , she encountered a great deal of success , yet that prosperity came with a high price – one that often mirrored the sexual abuse from her childhood .

It seemed incumbent on me to challenge my training as a traditional “ therapist ” i.e. , the kind that sits on their ass in an office all day .
Around that same time , I was talking with my friend Matt about his work as an escort , how often most of his sessions centered around a naked man telling him his inner thoughts and fears .
I realized that as a sex worker Matt ’ s clients were often more open and trusting with him than many of my clients were being with me — that people in general are so much more honest and vulnerable when they are naked than when they have their clothed defenses on .

When someone is undetectable they are untransmittable , meaning they can not give HIV to their sexual partners ( “ U=U ” ) .

Anyone recruited into the trial will need to attend their sexual health clinic trial site four times a year for as long as they are in the trial , in addition to a recruitment visit at the start of the trial .
Trial sites are sexual health clinics across England and more than 150 clinics across England are taking part .
Only sexual health clinics are serving as trial sites .

Like the demon-possessed man who ripped his chains apart , we often live in external freedom , but internal bondage .
Satan wants you to live in bondage .
It ’ s not just the amount of pornography that has increased .
What ’ s more troubling is the type of pornography that has increased .
Satan wants you to live in bondage .
Because he had external freedom but internal bondage .
So here ’ s the first point : Satan wants you and me to live in bondage .
They capitalize on our desires and the lies we believe in order to draw us away from God and drive us into deeper bondage .
I found myself praying this prayer : “ God , please don ’ t let Satan use this time to drive our people into deeper bondage .
He doesn ’ t just want you to sin ; he wants to use your sin to draw you away from God and drive you into deeper bondage .
Satan wants you and me to live in bondage .
In all of the dirt and the mess—the sin and bondage that eats us away from the inside out and makes its way into our lives—Jesus shows up .
Come out , and bringing your condition , your bondage , out into the open .
We have these issues that keep us in bondage .
Satan wants you to live in bondage .
Today , right now , in the midst of this social distancing with all the storm swirling around us , he wants you to live in bondage .
Jesus has set me free from an addiction to pornography .
I was constantly hiding in the dark , watching pornography , gratifying myself sexually in ways that were doing damage to my own heart and damage to my relationship with God .
Our bondage has power over us , but it does not have power over You .
So in the name of Jesus , I pray for every single person watching this right now , that You would break the bondage they ’ ve been experiencing in their life through the power of Jesus Christ and he power of Your Holy Spirit .
Thank You for turning our bondage into freedom .
Yeah , shit got real .

Background variables included the respondent 's sex , age group , social group , education , and the place and area of residence .
It affected everyone , no matter their gender , sexual orientation , or any other status .
Thus , they think the “ more masculine ” of the pair ( no matter if it ’ s a gay or lesbian pair ) , should be the breadwinner , while the “ more feminine ” one should adopt those tasks that are habitually ( and wrongly ) referred to as “ the female ones. ” The great thing about gay relationships is that they know that this is bullshit .
Does that mean that men , no matter the sexual orientation , feel the need to be the breadwinners no matter what ?
Gay sex is different from the straight one , that much is clear .
However , gay couples also have an entirely different approach to sex .
Their relationship to their sexuality and , consequently , their expression of it , isn ’ t as straightforward as some might think .
Historically , society often thought of queer people , especially gay men , as more sexually promiscuous .
That can be a way of spicing up their sex lives or merely a way of living .
Separating Love and Sex Gay men also have an easier time separating love and sex .
That is partially because straight couples are thought to be monogamous and believe in the “ one sexual partner for life ” company line .
However , they still have a more laid-back approach to sex .
There ’ s no social programming in terms of sex and fidelity .
Most gay couples strive to discuss and negotiate their sexual relationships as far away from heteronormative expectations as they can .
It ’ s important to note that , generally speaking , lesbian relationships conform neither to the heteronormative nor the gay male notions about sex .
Lesbian sex is traditionally more tied to emotions .
Of course , that ’ s not to say that lesbians and other LGBTQ+ couples don ’ t have a more open relationship to sex than straight couples .
Generally speaking , most LGBTQ+ couples discuss sex more openly and approach this topic with less prejudice than straight couples .
Maybe seeing a gay family member in a stable , loving relationship is the push they need to see them and their sexuality as valid .
Setting boundaries at work is difficult , no matter the sexual orientation .
Others might subtly dismiss them at their workplace due to their sexual orientation .
Gay couples don ’ t have that issue , as their social circles usually include people of similar views and , even though it ’ s a stereotype , gender and sexual orientation .
Gay men also enjoy the privilege of acting age-inappropriately because those that aren ’ t parents , don ’ t feel the pressure to be seen as “ responsible adults. ” They also have more money than other couples , given that they are still men and earn more than women , no matter their sexual orientation .
Experimenting with sex , drugs , alcohol , relationships , etc .
Men criticize them and view and treat them as sexual objects .
So , the remarks that cut the deepest come from the same sex .
Now imagine how hard it is to date people of your own sex , knowing that they are judging you and your appearance just as much as you judge them .
While we can ’ t support either of these extreme statements , the fact remains that gay men and all other LGBTQ+ couples approach relationships , sex , work , family , and all other important life issues in a different way than straight people .

From : The Element Encyclopedia of Secret Signs and Symbols Posted in Body Signs | Tagged Apple | Leave a comment Apple Symbolism and Lore The apple , that infamous fruit said to have been given by Eve to Adam , is a symbol of sexual awakening , and has deep associations with magick .
Five , comprised of the feminine number 2 and the masculine number 3 , is the number of harmony , of the union of opposites ( for example in sexual congress ) , and of marriage .
They became not only aware of their own sexual natures , but they realized that they could make their own choices .
Here the pentagram stands for the spiritual nature of man , and eating it awakens Adam to new possibilities ; the flesh combines with the spirit , and immediately Adam and Eve cover their genitals , signifying sexual awakening .
These stories and others , gave the apple its erotic connotations .
But what were these to the Israelites amid the bitterness of their bondage in Egypt ?
The bondage in Egypt embittered the gifts of God , yet even then a patient and willing soul would find something to be thankful for .
And as God chose the Passover season , when the great deliverance from Egypt was celebrated , for that death and resurrection of Christ whereby he delivers his people from guilt , and spiritual bondage , and helplessness , so he chose Pentecost for the entrance of that Holy Spirit who makes the deliverance to be followed by such unspeakable positive consequences .

Disagreements over sexuality are hardly new at religiously affiliated colleges .
The university accepts as “ settled and binding ” the church ’ s position that sexual relations are prohibited outside of marriage , which is defined as a “ covenantal union between a man and a woman. ” The case at Calvin has a turn-of-the-century feel , conjuring up the contentious debates that consumed the nation ’ s politics before the U.S. Supreme Court , in 2015 , ruled that same-sex couples have the constitutional right to marry .
Florida attracted national attention with its recent enactment of a new law — branded by opponents as the “ Don ’ t Say Gay ” bill — that prohibits classroom instruction about sexual orientation in some elementary-school grades .
Calvin bills itself as a welcoming environment for all students , while forbidding sexual intimacy outside of heterosexual marriage .
But the response to Kuilema ’ s case suggests that , at least for some faculty members , the university ’ s hard-line positions on sexuality are increasingly untenable and out of step with what some professors believe and practice in their own congregations .
In a letter explaining the board ’ s decision , Craig H. Lubben , the board ’ s then chairman , cited an internal document , “ Homosexuality and the Calvin College Community , ” that declares “ sexual abstinence is the biblically prescribed course of conduct for homosexual persons. ” Disagreements are acceptable and consistent with the tradition at Calvin , Lubben wrote , but “ tone and strategy are very important ” when disagreeing with a position of the church .
The college ’ s standards on sexuality often felt simultaneously murky and oppressive to Sweda , but Kuilema was an affirming force — a known ally for LGBTQ people at Calvin .

Miley Opens Up About Her Love Life Lessons Miley Cyrus Says She Lost Her Virginity to Liam Hemsworth at 16 and Lied About It for Years By Alyssa Bailey Published : Aug 14 , 2020 Miley Cyrus gave one of her most candid interviews ever about her love life and sexual history , appearing on Alexandra Cooper 's Call Me Daddy podcast .
During her hour-long interview , Cyrus revealed who she lost her virginity to ( her ex Liam Hemsworth , who would ultimately become her husband ) , how her first sexual experience was actually with women , and what she is looking for in a partner now .
Cyrus spoke to Cooper about how she was sexually attracted to women before men .
When asked about when she had sex with a man for the first time , Cyrus said , “ Well , I didn ’ t go all the way with a dude [ until ] I was 16—it wasn ’ t Nick Jonas—but I ended up marrying the guy .
It ’ s such more of a full circle story , it ’ s so f * cking weird because I couldn ’ t think of anyone who was like , 'oh , who have you had sex with ? '
and I couldn ’ t think of anyone so I just made somebody up who I knew , but we had never actually had sex before and then his friend ended up marrying him and then it was like , 'oh , my friend is marrying someone you ’ ve hooked up with , ' and then when I was like , 24 , I had to say that I lied when I was 16 .

He ends the sonnet bemoaning how nature slipped up at the last moment and added a penis to the youth , or , ‘ pricked thee out for women ’ s pleasure ’ .
It ’ s hard to believe the poet sees this penis as a deal-breaker , though , given the 125 other sighing poems he addressed to his ‘ master mistress ’ .
The poet-narrator is nonetheless having sex with her ; in sonnet 133 , more remarkably , it transpires that the Fair Youth is sleeping with her too .
While close and passionate friendship between men was normal at the time , it was not usual for men to dwell obsessively on the beauty and sexuality of their platonic friends , much less to write more than 100 sonnets about it .
In Such Is My Love : A Study of Shakespeare ’ s Sonnets ( 1985 ) , the critic Joseph Pequigney notes of Malone ’ s theory : ‘ No supporting instances of these customary addresses are cited by Malone. ’ Even C S Lewis , who remained unwilling to believe that Shakespeare engaged in ‘ full-blown pederasty ’ , admitted in 1954 that he could find no heterosexual explanation for the sonnets : ‘ [ Their ] language is too lover-like for that of ordinary male friendship … I have found no real parallel to such language between friends in 16th-century literature. ’ Furthermore , sonnets were strongly associated with sexual love throughout this period .
But the whole thing becomes preposterous when we are asked to believe that , when he added a fictional woman to the mix , he made her a dark-skinned , syphilitic , conventionally unattractive person who was also fucking the man from sonnets 1-126 .
The idea , first mooted by Michel Foucault , and then exhaustively documented in Alan Bray ’ s book Homosexuality in Renaissance England ( 1982 ) , is that early modern people didn ’ t conceive of sexual orientation as identity .
Rather , gay sex was understood as a sin that all men were prone to , which reflected not a preference for men , but a general depravity .
In theory , sodomy was a heinous crime , punishable by death .
The poet Michael Drayton mocks the lord who prefers his ingle to his female mistresses : ‘ Yet , more than these , naught doth him so delight/ As doth his smooth-chinned , plump-thighed catamite. ’ John Donne , in his first Satire , mocks a profligate friend for interchangeably enjoying ‘ thy plump muddy whore or prostitute boy ’ .
Schools and universities were also often described as places where boys were taught sodomy , and the fear was not that youths were being corrupted by homosexual teachers , but by sinful ones .
The sexual fluidity implied by these accounts was probably real .
Most early modern men didn ’ t marry until their late 20s , and – especially when they lived outside cities – their sexual opportunities with women were extremely limited .
When the combination of sexual frustration , youth and co-sleeping led to predictable results , it was generally winked at .
In theory , sodomy was a heinous crime , and punishable by death .
They were fully conscious , for instance , of female sexual desire , but added to this a touching belief that a woman couldn ’ t conceive a child without having an orgasm .
But James also told his son solemnly that sodomy was one of those ‘ horrible crimes ’ a king was ‘ bound in conscience never to forgive ’ .
The fact that the line between gay and straight wasn ’ t sharp doesn ’ t mean that sexual orientation didn ’ t exist , or even that it was invisible to early modern people .
However , sexual orientation had no social importance .
In writings of the time , we find no hatred or mockery of men for simply preferring men , only for having sex with them .
You don ’ t need anyone to tell you you ’ re different when the straight boy you dream about all day is only using you as a sexual stopgap .
There are countless third-person denunciations of sodomy , but not a single first-person description of a tavern or inn where gay men meet ; no memory of a circle of gay friends ; no unambiguous description of gay love that is not in the language of obscenity and disgust .
These aren ’ t coy verses about pretty Roman shepherd boys , but intense poems written to a real person The Elizabethan theatre was generally connected in the public ’ s mind with effeminacy and sodomy .
What ’ s more , an acting company in any period – especially one that goes on the road – is an intense , incestuous group , prone to filthy jokes and irresponsible sexual pairings .
It ’ s not at all improbable that sometimes a coded message came through , that gay love dared to speak its name , if only in the safely distant frame of ancient Rome or Verona or Venice – places associated in the Jacobean mind with the practice of sodomy .
Young courtiers continued to feign erotic longing for Queen Elizabeth well into her old age .
However , the simplest explanation , the one that best obeys the principle of Occam ’ s razor , is that both Shakespeare and the Fair Youth were gay or bi , against the backdrop of a fluidly sexual society where such distinctions made less difference than they do today .

Aldin myth says that the bodiless spirits that descended into the material world were without and beyond gender , but that the bodies fashioned for them by the gods possessed sexual characteristics , leading to the creation of male , female , and those who were some measure of both , neither , or transitioning between the two—the laevvel .
Aldean religion also believes in reincarnation of those bodiless spirits , so everyone has been ( or will be ) every sex , gender , and race at some point .
In particular , Aldin sexuality is less stigmatized , and far more openly mapped on a kind of bell curve , with the majority of people attracted to persons of either or any gender , and minorities as either end of the spectrum who are only attracted to either their own or another gender .
Again , bisexuality ( or even pansexuality ) isn ’ t “ normal ” in Aldis in that there is a value judgment attached it it , it ’ s merely so common that there isn ’ t a particular name for it , whereas those with primarily same sex attractions are caria daunen ( lovers of the dawn ) and those with different sex attractions are cepia luath ( keepers of the flame ) .

James McLucas , a priest of the Archdiocese of New York accused of sexual abuse of an adult woman in 2012 , and who has since assisted the SSPX in the U.S. on occasion due to his interest in traditional doctrine and liturgy .
This lawsuit , which commenced on July 13 , 2012 and concluded on September 23 , 2013 with a private settlement ( including a confidentiality agreement ) , is the primary subject of James Baresel ’ s initial article , wherein he summarized : “ In 2012 , McLucas was sued by Maureen Nysewander , who alleged sexual and physical abuse by the priest between 2007 and 2009 , when he acted as her counselor .
Both parties signed a confidentiality agreement not to disclose the contents of the lawsuit , but court documents are available online. ” Baresel provides a link to the initial “ Summons and Complaint ” filed by Nysewander ’ s lawyer on July 13 , 2012 ( an “ Amended Complaint ” was filed six days later ) , which includes Nysewander ’ s core accusation : “ On or about July of 2007 to December of 2009 , Plaintiff Maureen Nysewander was sexually abused , attacked and harassed by Defendant James McLucas ” ( para .
McLucas has vehemently denied Nysewander ’ s allegations from the beginning , contrary to Church Militant ’ s false claim that “ McLucas has never denied that he engaged in sexual relations with [ Nysewander ] . ” ( See CM ’ s anonymously authored “ SSPX Defends Sexual Predator ” article in response to the SSPX press release of July 24 .
McLucas ’ inclusion in the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report ( released Aug. 14 , 2018 ) , which dealt exclusively with cases of child sexual abuse .
It was while he was serving in that assignment that the convent ’ s mother superior learned he was engaged in a sexual relationship and reported the matter to ecclesial authorities. ” Again , notice how Baresel presumes guilt by asserting without evidence that Fr .
McLucas “ was engaged in a sexual relationship , ” as if Nysewander ’ s allegations in and of themselves prove guilt .
McLucas “ had sexually abused a 14 year old [ sic ] girl , ” an inaccurate description of Nysewander ’ s 2012 allegation that somehow found its way to the monastery ’ s mother superior , who then “ called the Diocese of Harrisburg ” and effectively ended Fr .
McLucas was well aware of her close friendship with Catherine Bauer and that the only reason he sought and obtained the chaplain position at the monastery was to “ re-insinuate himself into Maureen Buckley ’ s life and to resurrect his dominion over and sexual relationship with Maureen Buckley ” ( Verified Counterclaims , para .
As mentioned above , the grand jury report ’ s one-page summary provides an inaccurate description of Nysewander ’ s allegations ( she made it clear in 2012 that the alleged sexual relationship between herself and Fr .
Unfortunately , Baresel contributed to the confusion by stating in his article , “ The initial accusation claimed that he had been having sexual encounters with a girl since she was 14 years old. ” This is patently false , as evidenced by the 2012 court records .
In this regard , the report so offends traditional notions of fairness that Father McLucas is compelled to publicly make this response denying each and every allegation in the strongest possible terms. ” ( Emphasis added ) And yet , in the face of this clear and comprehensive denial , Church Militant would have us believe that “ the reason for his objection to being named in the Pennsylvania grand jury report ” was solely because the report “ only dealt with abuse of minors , not adults , ” and likewise , “ McLucas has never denied the allegations in question , namely [ , ] having sex with a young woman he had been counseling from a young age. ” Christine Niles has personally pushed this false narrative on social media , commenting to myself and others on the Catholic Family News Facebook page ( Aug. 1 , 2019 ) : Comment on the Catholic Family News Facebook page ( Thursday , August 1 , 2019 at 2:50 PM ) In reply , I asked her : Niles did not respond to my question .
Baresel then uses this fact to accuse the SSPX of negligence for allowing a priest “ suspended for sexual misconduct ” to assist them on occasion and asserts , “ Basic vigilance on the part of the SSPX would by now have led the organization to cease its association with McLucas. ” The irony is that the “ Update on the Sexual Abuse Crisis ” published by the Archdiocese of New York emphasizes : “ The inclusion of a cleric ’ s name on the list does not state or imply that he is guilty of a crime or liable for any civil claim .

Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens , the atheist author , have asked human rights lawyers to produce a case for charging Pope Benedict XVI over his alleged cover-up of sexual abuse in the Catholic church .
The Pope was embroiled in new controversy this weekend over a letter he signed arguing that the “ good of the universal church ” should be considered against the defrocking of an American priest who committed sex offences against two boys .
It was dated 1985 , when he was in charge of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , which deals with sex abuse cases .
The institutionalised concealment of child rape is a crime under any law and demands not private ceremonies of repentance or church-funded payoffs , but justice and punishment. ” MORE RELATED : Ms. Costello , now 48 and on disability because of arthritis , says that Mr. Kiesle — who was ordained as a priest in 1972 — first playfully invited her to sit on his lap , part of a youthful demeanor that he fostered , she said , including wearing purple tennis shoes in church .
And who doesn ’ t like a big kid ? ” But Ms. Costello says Father Kiesle ’ s touching and tickling soon progressed to fondling her chest and genitals .
“ I always knew that I was uncomfortable and that it wasn ’ t right. ” Her account came on the same day a priest in Massachusetts used his sermon to condemn the church ’ s handling of the broader sexual abuse scandal , describing some in the clergy as “ felons ” and suggesting that Benedict resign .
Yet it ’ s a common misconception that sexual orientation develops at an early age and then remains stable throughout one ’ s life .
Rather , changes in sexual orientation are a common thread in many people ’ s lives .
People may experience changes in who they are attracted to , who they have sex with , and which labels they use to describe their sexual orientation .
Such changes in sexual orientation are called sexual fluidity .
Attraction , identity , and behavior While anyone can experience changes in their sexual orientation , sexually fluidity is more common in younger people and among people who are LGBTQ+ ( lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender , queer , and additional identities ) .
changes in sexual behavior : Someone may have a sexual partner at one time point who is a cisgender woman and then have another sexual partner at a different time point who is nonbinary .
For some people , sexual fluidity occurs when they meet people and discover new attractions .
For other people , sexual fluidity may occur when they learn a new identity label that better fits their experience .
Misconceptions and stigma about sexual fluidity Many people may have questions and biases about sexual fluidity .
Are people who identify as bisexual sexually fluid ?
Sexual fluidity may be experienced by people with any sexual orientation identity , including people who identify as bisexual , lesbian , gay , or heterosexual .
Stigma directed at sexual fluidity ( and similar stigma surrounding bisexuality ) may stem from misconceptions about changes in sexual orientation .
Consciously or unconsciously , some people may believe that anyone who experiences changes in their sexual orientation is promiscuous or incapable of being monogamous .
Growing evidence links different forms of stigma experienced by people who are sexually fluid with more depression and poor mental health .
Yet it ’ s not the change in sexual orientation that raises this risk , nor is it automatic , genetic , or otherwise predestined .
The higher risk of mental health concerns among people who experience sexual fluidity is more likely to be related to minority stress — that is , because sexual fluidity is stigmatized , people who experience that stigma may also experience stress that negatively affects their mental health .
Changing misconceptions and stigma about sexual fluidity We can help normalize sexual fluidity in several ways .
First , we can introduce the possibility of changes in sexual orientation as part of sex education in schools and in the doctor ’ s office .
Second , we can work toward responding to sexual fluidity with openness and curiosity rather than making assumptions and viewing these changes as negative .
Third , we can move beyond preconceived notions of sexual orientation as stable to expecting change in sexual orientation for some people .
Sexual fluidity reflects one possible change over time , a change that fits into the greater diversity of sexuality .
We can all hold space for this diversity by letting go of misconceptions about the stability of sexual orientation over a lifespan and staying open instead to the possibility of change .

As Eric — Wexler ’ s Chief of Staff — reveals early in the first episode , “ Fighting the Good Fight , ” he was young when he decided to pursue “ politics. ” He ran for his local school board at age 18 , as a Republican , and eventually had to face the disjunction between his commitments and his party : “ I had to come out as a Democrat before I came out about my sexuality , ” he remembers , both identities equally significant in his self-understanding and , as he came to see , his self-presentation .
The perpetual lack of time and abundance of chaos bring tensions that reveal the staffers ’ sense of “ family. ” Eric describes Communications Director Lale Mamaux , she ’ s “ like the typical wife : she fights and screams at me and tells me what to do and doesn ’ t have sex with me. ” They see the humor in such situations , even as they argue passionately .

This set of defenses usually focus on one of the following arguments : Consent : for instance , a defendant in a rape case may claim that the intercourse was consensual .
Conflict has a devastating effect on civilians , including increasing the vulnerability of women and girls to sexual violence .
Rape and other forms of sexual violence have long been used as a weapon during war .
The UN then recognized sexual violence as a war crime with the passing of UNSCR 1820 , which declared “ rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes , crimes against humanity or a constitutive act with respect to genocide. ” Thousands of women and girls were captured by ISIS , subjected to rape and forced marriage , and often bore children as a result , with women and girls from minority communities most affected .
Children are often born as a result of violent rape and non-consensual relations between women and their captors .
She said that the UNSCR resolutions had been helpful because they criminalized rape in war , which in turn can help to transfer some of the stigma away from survivors and on to perpetrators .
For women who have children following rape during war , stigma for both the mother and child is a recurring theme across cultures ; despite the fact that these women and their children have survived terrible acts of violence , their societies , have stigmatized them for both religious and cultural reasons such as a woman ’ s honor being associated to her ‘ purity ’ , adding further barriers to their acceptance .
Caleb Odhiambo , Senior Program and Protection Manager at SEED Foundation , who worked for NGOs across Africa before joining SEED , notes that it is deeply unfair to burden a child who did not ask to be born or their mother who survived sexual violence with this stigma and rejection , furthe prolonging the effects of the war .
Ghlesa highlighted some success in Tunisia , removing the stigma of being born due to rape has been achieved by having the word ‘ bastard ’ removed from the law and changing the way that affected children are named so as not to automatically be stigmatized from their name alone .
She underscored the importance of listening to women and stressed that their rights and choices must be respected , explaining “ if they decide to keep their children born of survived sexual violence and war rape , it is very important that the women make this decision .
Odhiambo was also keen to emphasize accepting children saying “ if we look at a child just as a child , then we start looking at them in the lens of possibilities , what possibilities does this child have ? ” The consequences of war , conflict , and sexual violence impact survivors and their societies for decades to come ; it is critical that as a society we come together and support survivors to heal .

If Sir Desmond Swayne wishes to look at the example of Northern Ireland—from what he says , I suspect he has not done so yet—he will see that adding a human rights foundation to the legislation does not remove any of the regulations around time limits , any of the importance placed on medical professionals or any of the safety requirements , nor does it introduce sex selection .
Indeed , when we have a Government who , as part of an international conference , chose to remove a commitment to the human rights of women around the developing world to access sexual and reproductive services , I know that that concern is merited .
When I probed the Health Secretary on the issue during departmental questions , I received a written ministerial correction clarifying that a sexual and reproductive health action plan is currently being drafted by the Department .
Thirdly , the Court has reaffirmed that there is no actual right to abortion , even in the—I accept—tragic case of rape .

Member can not say that there is no late termination , because she does not know ; she can not say that there is no sex selection , because she can not know .
Given the train of thought he is coming up with , would he support the right of women to choose to have an abortion were they a victim of rape or incest ?
He then said that he would rule out abortion in all circumstances , including rape and incest .
This could lead to legal uncertainty , and to divergence from the case law of ” the European Court of Human Rights , “ since positive obligations are an important principle applied by the Court to ensure practical and effective protection of rights , particularly for people whose rights are most vulnerable to abuse ( such as children , victims of sexual violence and people seeking asylum ) . ” Everyone in the Chamber will be familiar with the case of John Worboys , the black cab rapist , who raped and sexually assaulted more than 100 women over the course of six years .
Labour will oppose the rights removal Bill , under which victims of serious sexual assault will lose the right to force the police to investigate crimes committed against them .

The Best Time to Have Sex Based on Your Chronotype | Well+Good When You Should Have Sex—Partnered or Solo—According to Your Chronotype Photo : Getty Images/Halfdark It 's an all-too familiar feeling : You and your significant other have just climbed into bed at the end of the day , and sex is the furthest thing from your mind .
Maybe you feel a little anxiety about this—is the passion gone ? —but according to Michael Breus , PhD , clinical psychologist and author of The Power of When , the problem is n't your relationship or sex drive , but rather your timing .
In fact , according to Dr. Breus , 72 percent of sexual encounters happen on what he calls `` the convenience rhythm , '' meaning people are already in bed , their partners are available , and the sex does n't interfere with work .
Typically , this turns out to be somewhere between 10 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. , he says , which is rarely the optimal time to have sex .
`` Your hormone profile really is n't as advantageous as it could be for you to be having sex at that particular time , '' says Dr. Breus .
Since melatonin is the sleep hormone , that 's one indication , from a hormonal perspective , that it 's not making a whole lot of sense to have sex later in the evening . ''
Instead , he proposes having sex on what he calls `` the desire rhythm . ''
According to this model , desire actually peaks in the morning , which is why morning sex is oh-so-good ( just me ? ) .
So , he encourages you to give it a shot , especially if you 're in a sex slump .
For women , it 's more difficult to measure , but when you ask them , they almost always report that they 'd rather have sex in the morning than at night , '' says Dr. Breus .
Of course , having sex early in the day is not always possible—nor is it universally preferable—so Dr. Breus has created a more involved guide that includes the best times to have sex based on your chronotype and your partner 's chronotype .
To figure out your ideal sex time , take Dr. Breus ' chronotype quiz .
Or , if you want to get more exacting , Dr. Breus offers a detailed chart in his book which lists the best sex timing for all the various combinations of chronotypes , gender , and sexual orientations .
If , ultimately , you can only have partnered sex at non-ideal times , Dr. Breus encourages masturbation during ideal times to reap some of the aforementioned benefits to your well-being .
Dolphins , says Dr. Breus , are best off masturbating at 8 p.m. so as to reduce cortisol and enable sleep ( they 're the troubled sleepers of the bunch ! ) .
And as for that late-night , partnered sex , Dr. Breus says you essentially need to lower your expectations around it to match your hormonal reality at that time .
`` Be less judgmental , add more variety , and try to decide that at least once a month , you 're going to ship the kids off to the grandparents ' house , or whatever it may be , and have sex in the morning , '' he suggests .

Holley Baker , a graduate of Texas Tech University , spoke at the Sundown Room on Feb. 3 in the Student Center at South Plains College about her experience with rape and what she learned and experienced while working on her documentary for her Masters of Art Education program in the School of Art .
That is , until Baker was a victim and survivor of rape herself .
During her journey to apologize to her friend , she interviews people on the streets of Austin , Texas , discussing what rape was , and some didn ’ t want to discuss such an uncomfortable topic .
Baker interviewed Lubbock District Attorneys , Lubbock officials , and professors at Texas Tech discussing the culture of rape .
We actually talked last week , and she told that me doing this documentary kind of opened and brought us both healing. ” Baker says that she realized that not only had she experienced rape , but she also was guilty of victim blaming .
All of a sudden that was relevant to the rape case .
It took me years to kind of deal with it and unpack it , and this documentary was my way of trying to seek some understanding for that. ” Baker started her documentary to look at the nature of sexual assault , because , to her , it seemed like for about a year every single woman she met had experienced a sexual assault in her lifetime .
“ Because , it seemed more like four and five in 6 and only one woman went to the police and reported it. ” In Baker ’ s documentary , she interviewed a woman who went to the police to report she had been sexually assaulted , and the woman explained and retold her story about how she had to tell at least 10 male officials about what happened and how it made her uncomfortable .
Baker says the reason why there are more male officials when dealing with sexual assault cases is because women tend to victimize more .
According to Baker , 93 percent of sexual assaults never make it to court .
From what the numbers that I was looking at , most rape cases never go to court .
They try to settle out of court. ” Baker brought up an interesting subject regarding why her documentary only consists of female sexual assault victims .
“ One of the high schools I went at I asked them , ‘ What would you do if your female friend was involved in sexual assault ? ’ ” says Baker .
It ’ s a big problem in the homosexual community. ” Baker explains her personal experience with being sexually assaulted and what she went through when it was happening to her .
‘ We went out on a date , he bought me dinner , maybe I should have had sex with him. ’ ” Baker still finds herself very open , but she explains that it is harder for her to open up to men because she still has this dangerous and bad relationship in the back of her head .
“ For them , sex is no longer enjoyable and it was something they had to do , even with a loved one .
I guess the only way to explain this is I don ’ t have a bad relationship with men , but with trusting sex .
Having a bad relationship with sex and how I view or see it. ” Since making her documentary , Baker travels to different schools and does a screening of her documentary , letting people know what sexual assault and victim blaming is really about .

Exodus 13:17-18 Meaning and Commentary INTRODUCTION TO EXODUS 13 This chapter begins with an order to sanctify or set apart the firstborn of man and beast to the Lord , Ex 13:1,2 and the people of Israel are charged to keep the feast of unleavened bread in its season , from year to year , when they came into the land of Canaan , the reason of which they were to acquaint their children with , Ex 13:3-10 and they are also directed , when come into the land of Canaan , to set apart every firstling of a beast unto the Lord , and particularly the firstling of an ass was to be redeemed with a lamb , or its neck to be broke , and all the firstborn of men were to be redeemed also , Ex 13:11-13 , and when their children inquired the reason of it , they were to be told it was on account of the Lord 's slaying the firstborn of men and beast among the Egyptians , when Pharaoh would not let Israel go , and of saving the firstborn of his people , Ex 13:14-16 , and it is observed , that when the children of Israel went out of Egypt , they were not led by the nearest way , the way of the land of the Philistines , but a round about way , the way of the wilderness of the Red sea , when they took the bones of Joseph with them , as he had adjured them to do , Ex 13:17-19 , and the chapter is concluded with an account of their journeying from Succoth to Etham , the Lord going before them in a pillar of cloud by day , and in a pillar of fire by night , Ex 13:20-22 .

I was oblivious to the sexuality of George Michael at the time who in 1996 had just brought out ( in my humble opinion ) his masterpiece “ Older ” with such stand out tracks as “ Jesus to a Child ” , which was dedicated to a man called Anselmo Feleppa , who as a naive teenager I thought was a close friend or musical collaborator of his , only to find out two years later that it was his deceased boyfriend/lover , which my classmates in high school derided by making slanderous gay jokes , and using puns based on his song titles ( including mainstream tabloid newspapers such as “ The Sun ” and other Rupert Murdoch lowbrow , trashy news outlets ) .
My main interest in gay pop singers ( whose sexuality seemed irrelevant to me ) , alongside the fact that I wore an earring and plucked my eyebrows , led to frequent teasing at school ( children can be cruel ) , with some “ friends ” even starting the rumour in school that I was in fact gay .
I believe it is a gay adults responsability to be openly gay and proud , so as to encourage younger gay teenagers by showing them , that there is nothing to be afraid of and that enjoying sex and sexuality is not a dirty secret , but rather part of the joy of the human experience , along with other physical pleasures such as music and food .
Lets put a stop to all the hypocrisy and at times religious , conservative demonization surrounding sex and sexuality … .
by openly admitting that a great majority of us enjoy and/or sex and/or some kind of physical intimicy and contact with another human being .
Talking about the joy of sex should be as normalized as discussing “ tennis ” It is no “ sin ” to enjoy the physical touch of another consenting adult , regardless of which part of their anatomy is involved … .

Social justice tends to focus more on just relations between groups within society as opposed to the justice of individual conduct or justice for individuals. ” I see it as a stand for equality , regardless of skin color , age , culture , religion , gender assignment or identity , sexual orientation , ability or disability , education , or socioeconomic status .
Protection of the environment , animal rights , gun ownership , voting rights , free speech , gender equality , police reform , sex , religion , food insecurity , whether or not to wear a mask , or receive a vaccine all have the power to cause conflict .
I laugh at many of them and realize that they are anything but nonpolitical since some are about sex , some about religion , and some about gender stereotypes .

A registered sex offender , Wagreich can not , according to state law , set up house within 500 feet of a school , daycare center , or park .
Back in 1997 , Wagreich took a plea bargain on a statutory rape charge , agreeing to serve 36 months ’ probation rather than stand trial .
Every year since then , she has registered as a sex offender , offering up to authorities her address and phone number and the details of her daily life .
A rape did take place that day , she says , but she was the one who was raped .
“ Amy was saying this man was trying to pressure her into having sex with him , and was threatening her with eviction and loss of work if she didn ’ t , ” Holmes said .
The rape .
“ Saying that you had sex with somebody has a very different connotation than saying somebody raped you , ” Holmes said .
“ And what happened to Amy was rape .
But when the detective said , ‘ Did you have sex with … ? ’ she , not realizing the difference , said , ‘ Yes .
Certainly the Lane County , Ore. , district attorney didn ’ t think so , and Wagreich was charged with statutory rape .
In the end , facing a two-year trial and a minimum of 20 years in jail if she were convicted by a jury , Wagreich pled guilty to rape in the third degree , accepted the probation , and beat a path back to Forest Park , where she and her daughters moved into an apartment on the 7400 block of West Dixon , next door to her mother and stepfather and their church .
That was in 1997 , three years before a new law went into effect in Illinois preventing registered sex offenders from living within 500 feet of schools , parks and day cares .

In their view , the world is witnessing a new dynamism of the Islamic Awakening Movement based on the model of resistance to the US and Zionists ’ domination ; the failure of US policies in the West Asian region and the defeat of their traitorous allies in the region ; [ and ] the expansion of the powerful political presence of the Islamic Republic of Iran in West Asia , and its wide-ranging reflection across the world of domineering powers .
Re-revolutionising Iran and the potential domination of jihadi management strategies is indeed built on the principle of antagonising the West and would , therefore , ultimately deepen the division between Iran and Western powers .

They want a savior to get them out of bondage .

Brian Killoran , CEO of the Immigrant Council of Ireland said , “ The absence of vulnerability assessments is particularly relevant for victims of trafficking , who have very specific needs , requiring gender-sensitive responses and specialised supports. ” Bulelani Mfaco of Movement of Asylum Seekers Ireland said , “ The Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland has always maintained that hotel and BnB managers are not suitable for providing supports for people who have survived and escaped deeply traumatic experiences such as torture and sexual violence .
It is essential to ensure that the specialised needs of vulnerable applicants such as victims of trafficking , those who have been subjected to rape , torture , or other serious forms of psychological physical or sexual abuse are identified at the earliest possible stage so that the requisite supports can be put in place .

People that register as sex offenders can often be misunderstood as `` molesters '' .
In the State of Mississippi , anyone ( with only minimal exception ) that has been convicted of a sex offense has to register as a sex offender for their lifetime .
Most surrounding states have misdemeanor sex offenses and/or offenses that do not require registration or only require registration for a certain time period , but Mississippi does not .
In rare cases , people that are convicted of other crimes have to register because the court feels they need to abide by the same rules sex offenders do .

A man of contradictions , Benedict leaves us two very different legacies The pope emeritus took the first strong steps to stop clery sex abuse , but ultimately prioiritized the institution of the church .
Benedict , for example , was the first pope to acknowledge the crimes of clergy sexual abuse and attempt to make amends institutionally .
Thousands gather in Vatican City as Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI lies in state Voice of the Faithful organized in 2002 in response to the astounding revelations of child sex abuse by clergy in the Boston diocese .
We often are reminded that , as Catholics , our perspective should not be “ either/or ” but rather “ both/and. ” I can also decry his failures to fully address the sex abuse of children by clergy , wonder why no one gave him a good recent book about gender and ask how a scholar such as him could ignore the case for female deacons .
Singing into the Piano worries over the consequences of globalization—the exploitation of cheap Mexican labor , the deforestation of the Amazon basin—while offering a far-fetched plot about sex and politics , love affairs and international affairs .
Mooney ’ s characters spend a good deal of time contemplating what , with a note of bombast , he refers to at one point as “ the worldly disorder that is in public called politics but that in private life has no simple name ” ( by which he often means what usually goes by the simple name of sex ) , and in Singing into the Piano he has produced a fantasy in which news of the world , its corruption , violence , and exploitation , reappears , as in a dream , in a distorted but revealing form .
It begins , as both of Mooney ’ s previous novels did , with a bizarre sex scene .
I ’ ll join you. ” The oddest thing about the book , though , is the sex , of which there is a lot .
They have sex at the UN , in cabs , in Central Park ( where they are arrested for indecent exposure ) , at home , occasionally , but with the curtains open and the lights on .
I can ’ t wait longer. ” She drew her knees up to her breasts and , as his cock slid into her , straightened out her legs so that they were pinned beneath his shoulders .
In pornography , though , things make sense : there is one need events will satisfy .
Here the juxtaposition of the image of the man in the sweatsuit mechanically working out with that of the acrobatic lovers is more nerve-racking and farcical than it is erotic .
Mooney confronts this problem by treating sex in a way that is both engaged and enigmatic .
Like Nicholson Baker in his imperturbable The Fermata , he gives sexual fantasy a free run .
Exaggerated as they are , though , the sex scenes in Singing into the Piano gradually assume the character of hypotheses , as if meant to tease and provoke the reader into thought—an ingenious , if risky , way to dramatize the problem of the limits of correct action , of what it means to go too far or not far enough , that has been announced in the novel ’ s opening scene .
For Mooney , sex , the ambiguous locus of love and/or desire , of blind passion and mutual recognition , is the primary , in fact species-preserving , instance of crossing those emotional and political borders which Santiago traces back to our intractably physical separation .
She too crosses the borders of the acceptable ( she sleeps with both James and her brother , a notorious Mexico City playboy , and also , it ’ s intimated , with her father ) , but coldly rather than passionately .
Elsewhere , however , Mooney seems all too earnest , and then it ’ s hard not to wonder whether a fantasy about a pair of true-hearted sexual exhibitionists can really hope to set the realities of rampaging global capitalism in perspective .
The book describes the vital importance of color naming semantics , stating that when naming colors used in pigments and dyes , names often refer to geographic location and evoke a deep sense of place-making , wonder and exoticism ; when naming colors used in retail , best practice calls for words that “ explore the beauties and wiles of the fair sex ” and yet still other names are best made fanciful and in vogue , intended for the writer and silvertongued of us all .
Forty years ago , conservative populist Phyllis Schlafly became a household name through her campaign against the Equal Rights Amendment , which infused traditional anticommunism with emerging anxieties about sexuality .
| Photo by John Locher/AP Gwen Snyder did exactly what the District Attorney Seth Williams ‘ Office says on its website a victim of sexual assault should do : She called the Philadelphia Police Department Special Victims Unit , and was transported to the Philadelphia Sexual Assault Response Center to file a report .
Since the alleged incident — Snyder says a fellow Pennsylvania delegate for Bernie Sanders made sexual contact with her that she did not consent to — took place July 27th at the bar of a convention hotel during the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia , she also told her story to state Democratic Party members and DNC staffers , in the hopes that the alleged assaulter would be stripped of his convention credentials .
Snyder did everything we tell victims of indecent and sexual assault they need to do .
Cameron Kline , communications director and spokesperson for the D.A. ’ s Office , confirmed to Philadelphia magazine on the morning of Monday , August 15th , that “ officially , the D.A. ’ s Office does not comment as a matter of policy about its charging decisions , but the incident was thoroughly investigated , and at the conclusion of the investigation the decision was made not to charge. ” Worse , when Snyder later called Jim Carpenter , the assistant district attorney who is chief of family violence and sexual assault investigations , to find out why , she says she was told one of the reasons they “ decided not to prosecute was because my attacker had been drinking to excess .
The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ’ s publication “ Alcohol and Sexual Assault ” states that “ conservative estimates of sexual assault prevalence suggest that 25 percent of American women have experienced sexual assault , including rape .
Approximately one-half of those cases involve alcohol consumption by the perpetrator , victim , or both. ” Campus Safety magazine states on its website that “ In 1 in 3 sexual assaults , the perpetrator was intoxicated , ” and that “ 90 percent of acquaintance rapes involve alcohol. ” The D.A. ’ s response galvanized Snyder .
She simply wants processes and procedures to change so that women who report sexual violence , harassment or indecent assaults have a chance at justice .

Living in a post-Vietnam era in-between Nixon and Ford , the soft sell of the “ sexual revolution ” having replaced political gains for American women ( the Equal Rights Amendment failed to pass in 1982 ) before their ( re ) immersion in the workforce , Mabel , the female protagonist of A Woman Under the Influence ( 1974 ) had few outlets for expressing herself and finding solidarity with other women as a LA suburban housewife .
Yet , upon scrutiny , Mabel ’ s personality is not marked by mature , socially pro-adaptive behavior , but by childlike naïvete , irrational thinking , and sexual impulsivity : signs of her stunted growth and lack of autonomous possession of her mind and body .
During Mabel ’ s off-camera six-month hospitalization we learn that she underwent electroshock treatments , an aggressive anesthetizing treatment in accord with the historic European treatment of hysteria : according to Elaine Showalter , the reformed Victorian asylum ( which in 1871 admitted 1,182 female patients to 1,000 male ) , like other Victorian institutions ( penitentiary , workhouse , factory ) was part of the paternalist tradition in which psychological domination and strict ordering of activities guaranteed deference from the female patients , whose minds were already atrophied by a lack of educative , cultural , and political stimulation .

This is the brutal freedom of improvisational art , whose epigonal subjects reject the compulsion to perform scripts of domestic bondage or neoliberal market commodification : instead opting to participate in the economic and cultural market volitionally , celebrating somatic ( or choreographed ) movement , natural ( or recited ) speech , and the pleasures of self-fashioning that threaten , by their very excess ( or restraint ) , the miasmic données of screen , stage , and law .

In Persona Humana ( 1975 ) the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith affirmed the perennial teaching that solitary sexual acts are immoral .
The principal reason is that “ the deliberate use of the sexual faculty outside normal conjugal relations essentially contradicts the finality of the faculty .
… It lacks the sexual relationship called for by the moral order , namely the relationship which realizes ‘ the full sense of mutual self-giving and human procreation in the context of true love ’ ” that are central elements of marriage .
In other words , the sexual faculty was made for marriage , where it is to be shared by a man and woman who have committed themselves to a lifelong union of mutual self-donation and sacrifice .
In such cases , practices are available that do not involve masturbation , principally use of a perforated seminal collection device during sexual intercourse .

1 Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free , and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage .
In the former part of this chapter the apostle cautions the Galatians to take heed of the judaizing teachers , who endeavoured to bring them back under the bondage of the law .
Since it appeared by what had been said that we can be justified only by faith in Jesus Christ , and not by the righteousness of the law , and that the law of Moses was no longer in force , nor Christians under any obligation to submit to it , therefore he would have them to stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free , and not to be again entangled with the yoke of bondage .
Under the gospel we are enfranchised , we are brought into a state of liberty , wherein we are freed from the yoke of the ceremonial law and from the curse of the moral law ; so that we are no longer tied to the observance of the one , nor tied up to the rigour of the other , which curses every one that continues not in all things written therein to do them , ch .

The global fight against sex trafficking is a hard fought one , but unfortunately COVID has caused many government resources to limit their movements , and many local law enforcement agencies to move resources around to help fight the ( other ) pandemic .
Even in terms of a well-off teen whose parents have continued working , the increases in screen time that teens ( and many adults ) are experiencing due to COVID boredom also result in increases in chances of being targeted by a predatory sex trafficker .
With that , simply being honest and telling your kids about the very real danger of sex trafficking and how they have increased due to COVID is most experts ’ best course of action .
With so many issues affecting the country and world , it ’ s also a sad truth that the rising numbers of sex trafficking victims is being underreported , so being a loud advocate and raising awareness is a way you can go above and beyond to help the cause .
The latter takes a little more creativity during lockdown , but even a Zoom happy hour with some big-hearted , open-eared friends can help spread the awareness needed to combat sex trafficking .

Vacuum pump to enlarge the penis One of the most common non-surgical penis enlargement methods is a vacuum pump .
Recall that in urology , the length of the genitals is considered small when it is less than 10 cm in an upright position .
If your penis is longer than 10 cm , seriously consider whether you really need to enlarge it .
Yes , vacuum pumps together with expanders allow you to effectively lengthen your penis , but their use can cause some undesirable effects , which we will talk about at the end of the article .
How the vacuum pump works The penis enlargement pump works as follows - a rare cavity is created around the penis and the cavernous trunks are stretched and pumped , which helps the blood to flow into the penis .
It improves blood supply and blood circulation inside the penis .
Thus , with Peyronie 's disease ( curvature of the penis ) or inflammatory lesions of the penis , the vacuum improves microcirculation in the penis and thus helps in faster tissue regeneration while increasing size .
In the first case , an air-filled cavity is created around the penis , in the second , the penis comes in contact with water , which is sucked in by the pump , and the tissues of the penis do not come into contact with the walls of the penis .
Contraindications to the use of a vacuum pump Thus , the use of the device is unacceptable : for painful erections , increased bleeding or taking blood thinners , as well as for congenital anomalies in the development of the penis .
Vacuum pump device for penis enlargement The vacuum pump consists of a cylinder in which a wide-based penis is placed , and the dome of the cylinder is equipped with a hole in which a special tube is connected to a pear or pump to create a vacuum inside the cylinder .
It also includes a special elastic silicone gasket with vacuum pumps , as the pump is placed perpendicular to the penis and helps to secure the cylinder firmly in the pubic area below the penis .
It is important to keep in mind that a vacuum does not need to be applied too quickly to prevent mechanical damage to the penis tissue .
An empty space is created until the penis begins to become upright .
The principle of using hydropumps is similar , but it allows you to create a faster vacuum area without the risk of damaging the tissues of the penis .
A hydropump is used when taking a shower , for which the cylinder is placed under the water on the penis and firmly attached to the bottom of the penis .
Water is then removed from the cavity of the cylinder , creating a unique cavity around the penis and helping it to lengthen .
Pump penis enlargement technique The penis enlargement procedure with a vacuum pump should be performed daily for at least six months .
Each man individually chooses a method to enlarge the penis .
If you are not ashamed to wear an expander for a long time , the choice in its favor will definitely be right , because it allows you to avoid the risk of damage to the penis .
On average , it is possible to achieve a penis elongation of 1 , 5 - 3 cm in 6 months when wearing an extension cord , and this result is slightly lower when using a pump , up to 1 cm for a similar period - but this is achieved with more discomfort in everyday life .
The expander should be fixed on the penis for a long time during the day .
Additional effects of the vacuum pump include the formation of small local hemorrhages in the penis as a result of the creation of an excessive discharge cavity around the penis .
Improper use of the vacuum pump can cause bruising and pain in the penis , as well as darkening of the color .

What message does it send to have Meatloaf blaring his fealty to `` the god of sex , drugs and rock 'n ' roll '' on your car stereo as you drive to church ?
Having sex on the Capitol steps .
Attempting sodomy in a men 's room .
As these well-documented cases of past misbehavior by federal lawmakers suggest , Congress does not exactly have a clean slate on the subject of sexual conduct .
By all accounts , the report will contain graphic descriptions of President Clinton 's sexual encounters with the former White House intern .
In the ensuing debate , will lawmakers who have had their own personal sexual scandals be rendered speechless , as Sen. Edward M. Kennedy , D-Mass. , was during the Clarence Thomas-Anita Faye Hill hearings in 1991 ?
Will those with skeletons in their closets also keep a stony silence , or will they pretend to be holier than Clinton -- and risk being outed as hypocrites and sinners in what one analyst fears may become a national `` sexual witch hunt '' ?
Already , allegations are circulating of sexual peccadilloes by lawmakers .
'' People in Congress have to recognize that if they criticize the president for shenanigans , their own sexual peccadilloes become fair game , at least in some people 's eyes , '' said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato .
No one knows , of course , the true rate of marital infidelity -- or any other form of sexual indiscretion or deviance -- among lawmakers .
But experts on sexual behavior in America said infidelity on Capitol Hill may be at least as high as the 20 percent to 33 percent range widely ascribed to the population .
Members of Congress `` are a group of people uniquely likely to have sex outside of relationships , '' said Pepper Schwartz , a sociology professor at the University of Washington and author of several books on sexual behavior .
Tom W. Smith , director of the General Social Survey conducted annually by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago , agreed that the number of sexual improprieties among lawmakers is likely higher than among the public .
There certainly has been no shortage of sex scandals on Capitol Hill in recent decades .
Also in 1976 , three other now-departed congressmen were engulfed in sex scandals .
John Young , D-Texas , was accused by a young aide of keeping her on the payroll primarily to have sex with him ; Joe D. Waggoner Jr. , D-La. , was charged with soliciting police decoys for purposes of prostitution ; Allan T. Howe , D-Utah , was convicted of soliciting two policewomen posing as prostitutes .
In 1980 , then-Rep. Robert Bauman , R-Md. , pleaded guilty to sexual solicitation after being accused of committing oral sodomy on a teen-age boy .
Others tarnished by scandals involving homosexual encounters have included Reps. Barney Frank , D-Mass. , who was reprimanded in 1990 for his relationship with a male prostitute , and Gerry Studds , D-Mass. , who was censured in 1983 for having sexual relations with a teen-age page .
Then-Rep. Daniel B. Crane , R-Ill. , also was censured in 1983 for having sexual relations with a female teen-age page .
In 1981 , Rep. Jon C. Hinson , R-Miss. , resigned after he was arrested in a Capitol Hill men 's room and charged with attempted sodomy .
Those embroiled in sex scandals have included ex-Sen. ( and former Transportation Secretary ) Brock Adams , D-Wash. , current Sen. Charles S. Robb , D-Va. , and former Reps. Gus Savage , D-Ill. , Donald E. Lukens , R-Ohio , Fred W. Richmond , R-N.Y. , and Jim Bates , D-Calif .
The most recent cases played out in 1995 as former Sen. Bob Packwood , R-Ore. , resigned amid allegations of sexual harassment filed by dozens of women , and former Rep. Mel Reynolds , D-Ill. , went to prison for having a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old campaign volunteer and obstructing the investigation into his actions .
Given the history of congressional sexual misconduct , Washington-based pollster Andrew Kohut said he believes that GOP lawmakers are likely to focus more on clearly impeachable offenses , if any , than on the president 's sexual indiscretions .

It ’ s sexy , it ’ s sweet , it ’ s ultra pretty in lots of ways .
Let ’ s say that her heightened sex appeal would probably make her a target of lechers on the crowded train .
Silky smooth , sexy on demand , sweeter than sugar , a clear ringing like the soft sounds of pure water trickling from a world beyond .
Third , the sexy sweetness of this character ’ s design is amazing .
They all have brown hair and big boobs .
She ’ s just pure sex appeal , which I don ’ t really like given she ’ s definitely high school age .
After all , this is pretty much a boob show sans the nudity .
Even among sexy girl characters a writer can do a poor job creating them .
Well , there ’ s ecchi and there ’ s ecchi .
These are good quality ecchi characters .
Beautiful , alluring , smart , sexy , passionate , sure of herself , she ’ s a dream girl .
The boob show is too much .
High school boob shows are always problematic , but this in particular bugs me .
Other girls have big breasts too , and they use them to get what they want .
Boi horny .
Their physical maturity is of a sexual nature only .
Nor do I need to launch into a diatribe on the ecchi genre again .
Most ecchi is egregious .
There is but a small area where some ecchi is artistically interesting , and that can be summed up in the sheer beauty of those being portrayed .
If you look at this show from that perspective—these girls are really beautiful , and the whole point of this particular ecchi series is to spotlight these beautiful girls , arousing our senses and making our blood pump harder .
But looking at this show from a broader ecchi perspective—it feels egregious .
I can only make so fine a point out of it without sounding ridiculous , but there are boob shows and there are boob shows .
Tawawa ’ s ecchi , while definitely meant to highlight female beauty , feels wrong .
No : it ’ s purely visual sexual stimulation .
That show is almost laughably ridiculous otherwise , even if the story is mildly important and decent for an ecchi series .
That kind of ecchi , when you ’ re dealing with high schoolers , crosses the boundary in my opinion .
The author strays too close to a realm where men of any age can sexually fantasize about high school girls .
If you don ’ t like ecchi at all , and I always will understand that , you obviously won ’ t like this show , because it is ecchi to the core .
But if you can stomach that or like this kind of thing , this show is stimulating both sexually and emotionally .
Not because it would legitimize their sexual portrayal , but because it would erase a lot of the current issues with that .
If you took all the boob stuff out of it , I ’ d still love this show and want endless seasons of it .

Renowned Congolese doctor and Nobel Prize winner Denis Mukwege on Monday played down his role at one of the NGOs ensnared in the snowballing Brussels lobbying scandal involving alleged bribes from Qatar and Morocco .
Mukwege , famous for treating survivors of sexual violence at his Panzi Hospital in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , sat on the honorary board of the human rights group Fight Impunity , established in 2019 by former Italian Socialist MEP Pier Antonio Panzeri , who is now in jail pending trial in relation to the scandal .
Along with the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize , Mukwege also won the European Parliament ’ s 2014 Sakharov Prize for his work to combat the use of sexual violence in wars .

While often at the receiving end of violence in the form of abduction , rape , mutilations and forced marriage it ’ s also important to acknowledge that women were also found to be perpetrators of violence during this period .

These games contain intense violence , blood and gore , sexual content and/or strong language .

Given the presence of limited literature on prevalence of T2DM associated sexual dysfunction in North Indian population , the following study was conducted with aim of investigating the prevalence of ED .
A total of 460 patients were asked to fill a validated International Index of Erectile function ( IIEF ) Questionnaire , and sexual dysfunction was assessed based on scoring for erectile function , orgasmic function , sexual desire , intercourse satisfaction , and overall satisfaction over a period of 4 weeks .
Thus , the findings of this study highlight the significance of taking follow-up of sexual discomfort and disorders by the clinicians during the visits .
IIEF Questionnaire Orgasmic function defect ( OFD ) Erectile dysfunction ( ED ) is a disorder characterized by the inability to attain and/or maintain an erection sufficient to allow satisfactory sexual intercourse .
OFD can be termed as incessant difficult or delay or absence of achieving orgasm post sufficient sexual stimulation leading to personal distress .
Anorgasmia is perceived absence of orgasm , independent of the presence of ejaculation .
Delayed orgasm is defined as a noticeable delay in ejaculation/infrequent or absence of ejaculatory response in75 % –100 % of occasions of partnered sexual activity without the self-desiring of delay , which persists for at least 6 months .
Patients with OFD may also have ejaculatory dysfunction including delayed ejaculations and premature ejaculation and anorgasmia .
Delayed orgasm and anorgasmia .
A study of various factors associated with sexual dysfunction in males with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
Given the attitude of the Indian society toward sexuality , along with the fact that men are usually embarrassed and reluctant to admit having ED , making precise estimates about the prevalence and severity of DM-associated ED in the country is difficult and warrants attention .
We have included the factors such as sexual stimulation , sexual intercourse , ejaculation and orgasm as sexual dysfunction factors in our questionnaire .
This study included sexually active male patients with DM , aged > 18 years visiting the study centers for consultation between August 2018 and April 2019 .
Moreover , sexual desire , intercourse satisfaction and overall satisfaction were also included .
Using the well-validated IIEF Questionnaire , we assessed ED and OFD based on scoring for erectile function , orgasmic function , sexual desire , intercourse satisfaction , and overall satisfaction in the past 4 weeks .
2.3 Study outcomes The primary outcome was to assess the prevalence of ED and OFD in patients with T2DM , while the secondary outcome was to evaluate various parameters associated with these sexual dysfunctions .
About 27.8 % had both ED and OFD , whereas a total of 48.4 % of patients suffered from a sexual disorder , that is , having either ED or OFD ( Table 2 ) .
A total of 48.4 % of patients reported a sexual disorder , that is , having either ED or OFD .

reported premature ejaculation in 40 % of patients with diabetes .
They also reported a strong association between ED and premature ejaculation ( odds ratio = 4.41 ; 95 % confidence interval = 2.08–9.39 ) in patients with T2DM .
Erectile dysfunction among men with diabetes is strongly associated with premature ejaculation and reduced libido .
As most patients suffer silently from ED and OFD , periodic screening for these sexual disorders among diabetic men is essential for early diagnosis and proper management .
Also missing is my favorite part of the biblical story : Noah ’ s drunken , nude , arguably homosexual post-flood celebration .
In other words , her body was not sexually mature , and she was not yet biologically an adult .
Another sign that you should start expecting your first period , is when you start getting a white vaginal discharge – spots in your panties .
Some may have a few brown or black spots in their panties and very little bleeding .
By doing this you won ’ t get such a fright when you discover blood in your panties and/or have period pain .
When you have your first period , you may not want to insert a tampon or menstrual cup into your vagina .
It ’ s also important to remember to remove the tampon because leaving it in could make you very sick with toxic shock syndrome.4 A menstrual cup , on the other hand , collects blood , and when you take it out of your vagina , you wash it and use it again .
Menstrual cups can last many years.5 If inserting something into your vagina doesn ’ t work for you , you can use sanitary pads or sanitary towels .
You put these absorbent pads on the panel ( gusset ) of your panties that goes between your legs .

On this basis , however , BUGB , BUS , or any church/association within either , is not acting in an 'unBaptist ' way if they choose to limit fellowship to people who think this way or that on Christology , human sexuality , or indeed economic theory ( I would add something like 'so long as in so limiting they genuinely believe they are discerning the mind of Christ from the Scriptures ' ) .
BUGB could , theoretically , be guilty of offending against freedom of belief if it could find , and ever chose to employ , some actually coercive method of enforcing conformity ( 'shut up about sexuality , or we 'll send the Regent 's Park first eight around to beat you up ' ? ! ) ]
[ Note 2 : I agree entirely with your point about contours ; I have complained to various leaders , past and present , from time to time that current practice amongst British Baptists - not just BUGB - elevates questions of sexuality to a prominence they do not deserve ; in that sense Baptist Faith and Message is probably more coherent , however much I disagree with various bits of it . ]
I suspect there is ample precedent , given the confusion over establishment , but this should still be a matter of deep concern to Baptists - it is far more important than any position on human sexuality . ]
Whether over the question of women in church , same sex relationship or speaking in tongues on the one hand , and , on the other , an appropriate way of expressing our interdependence as a group of churches each of whom has liberty to determine the mind of Christ .
( I edited a cheeky remark about whether Paul would have made a good baptist ) And I agree with Steve H that current practice amongst Baptists elevates questions of sexuality to a prominence they do not deserve .

Capitalism Is a Mental Illness : “ Hustlers , ” “ The Known World , ” and a Failed TV Project November 6 , 2019 • By Annie McGreevy IN THE SUMMER of 2016 , a director I knew put together a small team of writers to develop a TV project set in a strip club .
I was 35 but could pass for younger , and he asked me to get a job as a cocktail waitress at a local strip club , in Ohio , to collect research .
The woman with the tiara kissed an ugly , lost-looking man with such tender passion , I would have sworn they were on their way to make-up sex .
My observation of the strip club in real life was more patriarchal than the film ’ s , for better or worse .
Each man paid a cover charge of 10 dollars to get in the door , watched beautiful women move in postures of love and sex , and if he wanted the company of one , he accepted it when she offered .

“ After acting to protect a child from sexual assault from an Afghan commander , SFC Martland was punished and could be kicked out of the military at any time , ” said Jay Sekulow , of the American Center for Law and Justice ( ACLJ ) .
“ What ’ s equally disturbing are reports that the military has allowed Afghanistan forces to sexually abuse young children on U.S. bases. ” On the ACLJ website , Sekulow wrote : “ Here ’ s the bottom line : SFC Martland acted in compliance with U.S. and international law and should not face punishment – and ultimately expulsion – from the military .

If Musk ’ s actions had anything to do with creating a better world , he ’ d donate the $ 475,000 he spent in 2014-2015 on Ad Astra to programs that support underfunded schools , run by people who actually know what the fuck they ’ re doing .
What really gets my fucking goat is that people actually think he is a good person .
He certainly cares about looking like a good person , but a truly altruistic individual would not lose his shit because someone else got to save a bunch of little kids .
They put fucking deck chairs out !

It was an amazing canteen because Fellini was shooting next door so all the actors and actresses with big breasts were sitting in the canteen together and I was in my costume of Frankenstein .
They had to piss and shit in their pants because he was talking for twenty hours .

“ To deflect international condemnation , the Iranian authorities have falsely claimed that Sakineh was sentenced to death for committing murder , when court documents clearly show that she was condemned to be stoned for having sex outside of marriage .
The Daily Telegraph brings us this extraordinary tale from the land of the sad oranges , where it seems the courts take a rather South African view on miscegenation : Palestinian jailed for rape after claiming to be Jewish A Palestinian man has been convicted of rape after having consensual sex with an Israeli woman who believed he was Jewish because he introduced himself as “ Daniel ” .
He was convicted of “ rape by deception ” following a criminal trial that has drawn criticism from across Israel .
After striking up a conversation , the two went into a top-floor room of a nearby office-block and engaged in a sexual encounter , after which Mr Kashur left before the woman had a chance to get dressed .
Although conceding that the sex was consensual , district court judge Tzvi Segal concluded that the law had a duty to protect women from “ smooth-tongued criminals who can deceive innocent victims at an unbearable price ” “ If she hadn ’ t thought the accused was a Jewish bachelor interested in a serious romantic relationship , she would not have co-operated , ” Mrs Segal said as she delivered her verdict .
A conviction for rape by deception on the grounds of racial misrepresentation is believed to be internationally unprecedented , according to British legal experts .
In 2007 , a Syrian pilot walked free from a court in Swansea after being accused of tricking a woman into intercourse by saying it could cure her of a sexually transmitted disease .
A court in Massachusetts also acquitted a man who allegedly masqueraded as his twin-brother in order to have sex with the man ’ s wife .
While forced sex by deception is an offence under Israeli law , legal experts say it is a charge used sparingly in cases involving protracted deceit and a promise of marriage .
Kashur was originally accused of violent rape and indecent assault , but later accepted the lesser charge under a plea-bargain after prosecutors received evidence suggesting the encounter was consensual .
What if this guy had been a Jew who pretended to be a Muslim and had sex with a Muslim woman .
Would he have been convicted of rape ?
“ If you want to enter a pub , you ’ d better not look like an Arab and if you want to have sex with an Israeli girl , you had better not look like an Arab. ” The prosecutor in the case was unavailable for comment and officials in the Jerusalem district attorney ’ s office declined to discuss it .
The upcoming novel by author J. P. Delaney has all of the makings of a sexy murder mystery that is sure to hit the bestseller chart , and it already has the movie deal to prove it . ''
The school connection in both games feels like it ’ s more for forced proximity , cliques , and shitty young person behavior than anything else—and because both games deal heavily with romance and sex , both are very clear about the characters being 18 or older .

The latest thing that I can think of is a movie that came out recently , over Valentine ’ s Day weekend , Fifty Shades of Grey , I did not see the movie of course , but everything I know about the movie , based on reviews , is what you would call soft pornography .
It is very interesting to me to watch the deterioration of our culture in this area of sexual morality .
And today the more we move into this area of movies , the more we move into this area of Netflix , the more we move into this area of You Tube , it ’ s rare to find sexual morality promoted .
I can not tell you how many people I know , if I were to read the names it would take the rest of the sermon time , how many men of God I know that are trapped or ensnared by pornography .
The thing about pornography , once you look at it you can ’ t stop looking at it .
It produces dissatisfaction with your spouse because he or she obviously can not compete sexually with that image that somebody has created .
And consequently the obsession with pornography , the viewing of pornography , I believe has done more , not only to destroy ministries but to destroy Christian marriages and the joy that God would have us to experience within the context of Christian marriage because of images that are in our minds .
But you see , let me tell you something about pornography : pornography is worse than poison .
And that ’ s why this viewing of pornography , this giving ourselves over and over again to sexually explicit material , and I realize that there is different degradations in this , some call it soft porn , there ’ s a difference between hard porn and so forth .
But soft porn , based on a book title I read some years ago , soft porn plays hardball… soft porn plays hardball !
And that ’ s what I ’ m talking about related to perpetual stands that the child of God has to take over and over again , not just in this area of sexuality but in many , many areas that I could speak of .
It ’ s called Obsidian , and in many ways it is kicking Notion ’ s butt .
abuse|child abuse|childhood|childhood emotional abuse|children|psychotherapy|trauma|trauma-related|web-only feature The Silence and Severity of Childhood Emotional Abuse Although treatment considerations for adults with histories of childhood physical and sexual abuse has grown over the years , psychotherapeutic treatment focusing on adults with childhood emotional abuse histories is in its nascency—at best .
Despite the nebulousness and silence surrounding this form of abuse , 36 % of identified childhood abuse cases report incidence of emotional abuse ( Chamberland et al. , 2011 ; Sedlak et al. , 2010 ; Tonmyr et al. , 2011 ) with emerging evidence that its detrimental impacts are at least equivalent to , and in some studies , found to be greater than among those who experience other forms of abuse ( e.g. , physical abuse , sexual abuse ; Burns et al. , 2010 ; Dias et al. , 2015 ; Hodgdon et al. , 2018 ; Nguyen-Feng et al. , 2017 ; Wright et al. , 2009 ) .
Even when controlling for exposure to physical and sexual abuse , which tend to overlap experiences of emotional abuse ( Dias et al. , 2015 ) , associations between emotional abuse and distress still persist ( Paul & Eckenrode , 2015 ) .
Furthermore , childhood emotional abuse has been linked with a host of increased mental and physical health concerns in adulthood , such as : anxiety ( Taillieu et al. , 2016 ) ; bipolar disorder ( Etain et al. , 2010 ) ; borderline traits ( Allen , 2008 ; Kuo et al. , 2015 ) ; depression ( Gibb et al. , 2007 ; Taillieu et al. , 2016 ; van Harmelen et al. , 2010 ) ; disordered eating ( Feinson & Hornik-Lurie , 2016 ) ; dissociative symptoms ( Briere & Runtz , 1988 ) ; externalizing conduct problems ( Caples & Barrera , 2006 ) ; low self-esteem ( Mullen et al. , 1995 ) ; negative affect ( Nguyen-Feng et al. , 2019 ) ; paranoid ideation ( Dias et al. , 2015 ) ; perceived stress ( Nguyen-Feng et al. , 2019 ) ; post-traumatic stress ( Wekerle et al. , 2009 ) ; relationship difficulties ( Bigras et al. , 2015 ) ; sexual problems ( Mullen et al. , 1995 ) ; sleep problems ( Wijma et al. , 2007 ) ; social anxiety ( Reinelt et al. , 2013 ) ; somatic symptoms ( Samelius et al. , 2007 ) ; and suicidal behaviors ( Bifulco et al. , 2002 ) .

My mentor and sexual counseling supervisor , Evelyn Resh , has 35 years of service in the sexual health industry and joins me today to talk all things pleasure .
As we get older , women in midlife and beyond can feel reticent about bringing up things to do with sex .
It is astounding how many women still don ’ t understand how their bodies work , but taking ownership over your pleasure and body will help you become empowered , and that ’ s what we , as sexual counselors , aim to do for our clients .
Join us this week as we share some tips to help you preserve your sexuality and become empowered in your own skin .
Why everybody must take responsibility for their own sexual needs .
The benefits of working with a sexual counselor .
How to establish your criteria for good sex .
And I ’ m also lucky that she is my mentor and my supervisor as I ’ m going through additional training right now , and certification as a sexual counselor .
And as I say she is my sexual counseling supervisor .
And of course we always end up talking about sex .
And then this thought about ageism and as we get older what it means to be a woman in the society and to be a sexual being .
Because I really believe in being a sexual being throughout our ages , it doesn ’ t stop in our 40s or 50s .
We get to be sexual in our 60s , 70s , 80s , 90s .
And so I just kind of wanted to talk to you about what are your thoughts about dealing with society and what they say that women of a certain age can and can ’ t do sexually .
I recognize these internalized ageism things in relationship to sex and it ’ s difficult to overcome .
Our skin is such a big part of our sexuality and we need to recognize that .
Sonia : I love that , when you said that , I was like , there is no statute of limitations on my vulva .
There is no statute of limitation on my clitoris , damn it , it ’ s working well .
I mean you may not be as well acquainted with your clitoris as you get older as you were when you were younger .
I think that it determines if she ’ s going to continue to be sexual after her 50s and beyond .
How she perceives herself as a sexual being , how she wants to approach the sexuality in midlife .
What do you think are topics , or ideas , or concerns that women in midlife should be addressing or should be thinking about at this point if they want to preserve their sexuality ?
Evelyn : Well , the number one thing that comes to mind for me because I ’ m an ob gyn specialist is vulva and vaginal health .
And how fewer than 25 % of women who struggle with vulva and vaginal changes secondary to perimenopausal and postmenopausal reduction in estrogen actually get treated and there is treatment .
And I think that what happens is the ageism , the overlay of ageism makes people blind to the issue of vulva and vaginal health .
And so they go in , they get their PAP smear done , they get out of there and they never talk to women about how does your vulva actually feel when you ’ re either self-pleasuring or when you ’ re in partnered sex ?
Is the clitoris sensitive ?
And my feeling is that once women get to be in midlife and beyond if they want to preserve their sexual function they have to preserve their genital health just like the rest of their health , which is intimately tied in to whether or not they ’ re going to be interested in being sexual at all , either on their own or with a partner .
But in my program , Own Your Sexuality Now , I do encourage women and anybody that ’ s listening to this podcast ; I definitely encourage you to actually look at your vulva to know what it looks like .
Know what it looks like right now because it will change over a period of time and you need to understand what your healthy vulva looks like and how it ’ s going to change over a period of time .
And the normal changes include a shortening of the length of the vagina , a narrowing of what ’ s called the entroitus which is the opening of the vagina .
So when you think about that and you think about what that is going to feel like for people when they want to continue let ’ s say having penetrative sex , either with fingers , or a dildo , or someone ’ s erect penis , a partner ’ s erect penis , whatever , or even stimulation .
When the genitals are dry they ’ re really uncomfortable to have stimulated .
This is a different application because there are receptor sites in the genital tissue that absorb this estrogen and keep it where it ’ s needed , which is right where the clitoris is , where the labia are , inside the vagina .
I also believe that it ’ s very important to have the localized estrogen treatment and that , the fact that you can actually use the cream and put it on your vulva region as well as opposed to just internally within the vagina .
So I wanted to shift gears a little bit because I also know that you do the sexual counseling side of things .
But I remember reading that ; it was about women and sexuality , and power .
Evelyn : Well , my sense of whether or not something is sexually pleasing is really based in what people ’ s relationships with pleasure at large is in their life .
And my book really makes this connection between pleasure across the board in our life , including sexual pleasure and feeling powerful as a person and to yourself .
This is true with sexuality also .
Their pleasure quotient is really low , and this is true for sex too .
So my feeling is the more pleasure we have in life , the more powerful we feel , the more powerful we feel the more drawn we are to pleasure and this includes sexual pleasure .
And I do consults , sexuality counseling consults .
It ’ s very strength building because everybody comes in with strengths around sexuality that they don ’ t realize they have .
Evelyn : I would have to say the most common thing I hear is an absence of libido or really low libido , just very little interest in being sexually active .
They don ’ t have a self-pleasuring practice , they aren ’ t having partnered sex and they want to know why .
And saying to them , “ Well , given that the way that you ’ re describing your life , given what ’ s going on in your life , I mean there ’ s nothing sexy about it .
Given what I just told you , no , nothing sounds particularly sexy , or pleasing , or comforting , or mind expanding .
It ’ s all about doing. ” And when we lead lives that are all about doing it ’ s a dead end for anything that ’ s going to be pleasurable , especially something sexual because we ’ re just using our bodies as means of locomotion .
In terms of , I talk about if you ’ re having to do list sex , which sounds like it correlates with just doing , the just doing side of things , versus for you sex and having that be more about along the pleasure lines .
Because so often women want to separate out sex from all aspects of their life , but it ’ s interconnected .
You ’ re a sexual being , you are a being and it ’ s part of your life and it ’ s not like you can separate it out and put it over in a corner in a box and put your sexuality over there and not have it affect every other aspect of your life , or connection and relationships just in general .
And one of the things that you and I have talked about often is about self-pleasuring practices and masturbation , and how important this is for women .
Or if you have a partner , you shouldn ’ t need to masturbate or you shouldn ’ t need to self-pleasure .
And my feeling is especially in midlife and beyond , if women are dealing with a lot of genital discomfort and complaints , that actually self-pleasuring and mutual self-pleasuring can become a much bigger part of their sexual expression than it was as a younger person because they ’ re going to know what feels good .
And there ’ s no such thing as vibrator rehab .
I mean I can ’ t tell you how many people have come to me and said , “ Well , I can only have an orgasm if I use my vibrator and have clitoral stimulation .
And that ’ s simply based on anatomy and how many nerve endings there are in the vagina versus the clitoris .
As a midwife who has done many , many deliveries , I ’ ve always said to people , “ Listen , if the vagina was as enervated and if it had as deep of a nerve bed as the clitoris does , nobody would have a baby .
Why would you have all the nerve endings in the vagina ?
And you ’ re like , “ The baby ’ s so cute , I think I want another. ” A year later you ’ re like , “ The baby ’ s growing up , maybe one more. ” But if you had all those nerve endings in your vagina you ’ d be like , “ One and done .
Can you just close up shop right now because I never ever want to experience that again ? ” Evelyn : Well , and I have a normal woman ’ s vagina and even I said , “ Could somebody just kill me ” , when I was in labor .
It ’ s not in the vagina , it ’ s in the uterus , it ’ s not the clitoris , it ’ s the uterus .
But I mean honestly , if you had as many nerve endings in the vagina you would just swallow poison before the baby got there .
And if we think about it , so many women are taught that somehow the best type of orgasm is a vaginal orgasm or a penetrative orgasm .
80 % of women need clitoral stimulation or a combination of penetrative and clitoral stimulation in order to have an orgasm with sex , right ?
If a woman just has her orgasm under herself and stimulates her very own clitoris and has this great orgasm , well , somehow it ’ s seen as less than .
And if it feels good then there ’ s no sex police I have to report to .
It ’ s kind of like keep your hands off my orgasm , but you could put your hands on my clitoris if you want to .
And get your hands out of my vagina because we ’ re not going to get very far .
If you really want me to cum , could you please move up ?
Sonia : And getting back to self-pleasure and masturbation , it ’ s kind of interesting that women sometimes have this guilt around masturbating on their own if they ’ re in a couple .
If they have a partner they kind of feel like they have to hide the fact that they masturbate or that there ’ s just this certain amount of sexual energy like a battery or something .
And that if they masturbate on their own the battery ’ s running down and it won ’ t be recharged .
And so then when they have sex or sexual intimacy with their partner they ’ re like , “ I ’ ve already had two orgasms this week so obviously it ’ s not going to work anymore ” , or whatever .
There ’ s this concept that I ’ d like to masturbate but if I masturbate then I ’ m not going to have anything left for my partner .
It ’ s like your body needs to be reminded that it ’ s a sexual being , and how to react to sexual stimulation .
If you ’ re not doing anything , you don ’ t really have an understanding about your clitoris and you ’ re only engaging in sexual intimacy when your partner ’ s around maybe , and when you ’ re in the mood .
Your body forgets how it operates , how it responds to sexual stimulation , right ?
Well , I have never really understood the orgasm conservation concept .
Reading something on a screen , when it comes to sexual health information , it ’ s just not the same as when you ’ re interacting with a sexual health expert or sexual health practitioner , let ’ s put it that way .
But when you ’ re working with a sexual counselor , a sexual therapist , you can specifically ask them .
And you might even be – I ’ ve had clients that didn ’ t exactly know where their clitoris was .
But you don ’ t see women ’ s genitals , I mean a lot of people shave their pubic hair unfortunately , I wish that was not the case .
But anyhow even so , even if people shave their pubic hair , they ’ re not really looking at each other ’ s genitals the same as when men see each other naked .
And she said , “ I can not believe that I have never looked at my genitals until now. ” And she was 83 or something .
And I always say that everybody has to take responsibility for their own sexuality and their own libido , and to make sure their needs are being met .
Generally speaking , not always , but generally speaking based on men ’ s biology , and the force of testosterone , and the fact that they have more testosterone than we ever will , they are going to have a stronger sex drive .
So what we customarily hear in the sexuality counseling world is , “ Well , her libido is less than his. ” So exactly what you ’ re saying , “ How do we bring hers up to his ? ” We never say , “ How do we bring his down to where hers is and they meet there in the middle. ” We never say that .
They ’ re not looking at men to try to suppress it , it ’ s always looking at women as if we ’ re broken , inherently broken because we don ’ t have that same sex drive .
Because if a woman is not really interested in having sex she still may be interested in being loving and giving while her partner self-pleasures , her male partner self-pleasures .
Brings himself to orgasm while she ’ s stroking him , kissing him , talking to him and saying things to him that are erotic , maybe arousing , talking out a fantasy , whatever .
Because sometimes I ’ ll say to people in a session , “ Tell me what your criteria is for good sex .
What they do is they qualify it if they ’ ve had intercourse , even if they have not enjoyed it , they still say , “ Okay , I had sex and it was okay. ” So what I try to do is help people really fine-tune what is it that feels pleasing to them that can encourage their engagement ?
Not necessarily their engagement in intercourse , but their engagement in skin-to-skin , soul-to-soul .
Sonia : Yeah , I love how you ask them what their criteria is for good sex because people don ’ t even know what their criteria is , especially women .
Sometimes they ’ ll even defer to their partner and they ’ ll be like , “ Well , if my partner enjoyed it then I guess that was good sex ” [ inaudible ] .
The intersectionality of all the different things that are in there , and when you ask somebody and you say , “ What do you like about sex ?
It ’ s okay if I require that I cum first before penetration ? ” These types of things , and yes , and this is where you ’ re talking about this power , right , the ownership of the pleasure and through ownership of the pleasure there is this gained pleasure and power that is in this situation ?
And how can you help me ? ” And I ’ m like , “ Oh boy , okay , let ’ s dial back and let ’ s help you define what does good sex look like to you , what ’ s the criteria , how do you meet it ?
You talk about mind blowing sex , this is just mind blowing in general that have not really even thought about what ’ s pleasurable to them .
If they could enjoy sex in any way , and I talk about this concept of the sexual smorgasbord where there ’ s this list of different sexual intimacy acts .
And you actually get to choose , the woman can choose , just like you ’ re at a buffet somewhere , you can choose what you want and kind of add that and create your own sexual intimacy that ’ s very pleasurable and one that ’ s curtailed and meant for you .
And I have one about raising sexually healthy teen girls and then the second one is Men , Women , Sex and Power : Getting the Life and Sex you want .

I Have Rules , and So Do You I just don ’ t know what the fuck to write about .
We know why it ’ s best to have a boring life because we ’ ve done all the stupid shit we can possibly think of and life is still hard , but it ’ s easier with rules .
Therefore , there has literally been enough time for us to see most , if not all , of the “ evidence. ” Evidence is the biggest crock of shit you will ever hear when it comes to God .

My grandmother and I used to speak about sex education from time to time .
Still , many people were surprised that this very religious woman in the South was all for sex education .

Home / Patient Care & Info / Urologic Subspecialties / Male Sexual & Reproductive Health What is Peyronie ’ s disease Peryronie ’ s is an abnormal curvature of the penis that occurs during an erection .
The disease is not a health threat , but it can sometimes cause pain with erection and/ or with intercourse , and interfere with a man ’ s ability to have sexual intercourse .
Peyronie ’ s disease sometimes develops when a hard lump of fibrous tissue ( plaque ) forms within tissue ( Tunica ) that envelopes the erectile tissues of the penis .
The cause of this disease is not well understood , but we believe it affects men who are , for unclear reasons , predisposed to abnormal and/or exaggerated scarring to even small tissue injuries The disease may result from trauma that causes bleeding within the penis , but that does not account for all cases .
Abnormal curvature of the penis is the most obvious symptom , with or without pain in the penis during erection .
Many men report noting a shortening of their penis .
Often a plaque can be felt when the penis is limp , and curvature becomes apparent when the penis is erect .
When the plaque is associated with pain , at UCSF , we often prescribe use of a medication called Pentoxifylline , which serves to improve blood flow to the penis , and often , to varying degrees , helps to halt the growth and calcification of plaques .
When the plaque is associated with pain , at UCSF , we often prescribe use of a medication called Pentoxifylline , which serves to improve blood flow to the penis , and often , to varying degrees , helps to halt the growth and calcification of plaques .
Surgical correction to correct the curvature is also option , particularly when the curvature prevents a man from having intercourse .
Penile straightening procedures developed at UCSF such as the 16-Dot Penile Plication procedure , straighten the penis while minimizing risk to the penile nerves that govern erection function .
For men with erectile dysfunction that is sufficiently severe that even use of erection-enhancing medications precludes satisfactory intercourse ( regardless of degree of curvature ) , then , surgical placement of an inflatable penile prosthesis is also an option , as the latter serves to both provide satisfactory erection and also straightens the penis .

Do I have to listen to my boss make comments about my sexual orientation ?
Given the relatively recent progress advancing lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( “ LGBT ” ) rights , the employment attorneys at Spitz , The Employee ’ s Law Firm have often blogged about LGBT issues in the workplace and about employment discrimination based on sexual orientation .
However , Title VII does not explicitly mention sexual orientation as a protected category .
Like our employment discrimination lawyers have been doing for the last decade in suing employers for the homophobic acts of bosses , managers , and supervisors , the EEOC has begun filing a series of lawsuits against private employers which the agency believes has discriminated against an employee or employees on the basis of their sexual orientation or LGBT status .
Even though Title VII does not explicitly mention sexual orientation as a protected category , the EEOC has taken the position that sexual orientation discrimination falls under the gender discrimination category .
This is because sexual orientation discrimination punishes employees based on the gender of who they have sexual or intimate relationships with .
One sexual orientation discrimination brought on behalf Yolanda Boone against Pallet Companies , d/b/a IFCO recently settled .
Her boss made several comments about the employee ’ s appearance ( and which tied into the employee ’ s sexual orientation ) , including “ I want to turn you back into a woman ” and “ you would look good in a dress. ” The supervisor also made sexually suggestive gestures to the employee .
While sexual orientation still isn ’ t explicitly protected under federal anti-discrimination in employment laws , the tide has clearly turned towards protecting gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender employees from discrimination .

And the early feminists directed their activities , particularly , to the rape crisis movement , and also to the refugee movement or the women ’ s movement , as it ’ s known in the United Kingdom .
The other way of looking at the actual behaviours that can constitute violence against women is something that Liz Kelly , who ’ s a very well known feminist researcher– she conceived of the idea of a continuum of sexual violence .
That ’ s because of a wider continuum of sexual violence that exists in society .
Intersecting gender , power , and violence in the different forms , physical , emotional , sexual and so forth .
Adam Lambert says he will be as “ gay as I f * * * ing can be and be flamboyant and wild. ” He made the comments at the 2023 Creative Coalition Spotlight Initiative Gala and said he will not apologize for flaunting his sexuality , adding , “ If it gets me into trouble , it gets me into trouble .

I was keen to explore the themes of work , home and community through the lens of sexuality , and create content that readers would find relevant and familiar , yet inspirational and progressive .
When a person breaks up with a long-standing partner or loses a close family member or friend , when people lose their houses during disasters , when people ’ s sense of fairness gets tarnished after a sexual assault or organizational indifference to dishonesty — in all these situations and more , the individual ’ s meaning starts to show cracks .

But in the capable hands of a boundary-pushing scribe like Ryan O ’ Connell , 32 , the condition is a conduit to honesty and self-acceptance—and an excuse for one of the most spot-on depictions of gay sex in TV history .

Again , this is a good source because you ’ re looking at the degree of sexual exploitation within American slavery , a topic that many would wish to ignore , but I think in terms of understanding slavery , I think the exploitation of black women by white masters as Winthrop Jordan talked about in his book , White Over Black , is something that needs to be discussed .
The film itself has a great deal of violence , it has a great deal of sexuality .
Less graphic , and if you really can ’ t use 12 Years of Slave in the classroom , you might look at the 1984 PBS production Solomon Northup ’ s Odyssey , in which a film historian Robert Brent Toplin plays a key role in producing , and that film raises many of the same themes but in a less graphic fashion in terms of sexuality and brutality .
Many people anticipated this film would do quite well at the box office , but one of the things that happened had to do with the film ’ s director , Nate Parker , and actually star as well , and that dealt with allegations of sexual misconduct by Parker , an accusation of assault from earlier in his career , in which the woman who made the accusations ended up committing suicide .
It 's PG-13 for just all the gunplay and sexual frustration in the world .

From a scene of all the actors pretending to have oral sex maybe 10 minutes in , to the first act ending with multiple actors standing on the stage with no clothes , I kept thinking to myself : “ Is this allowed ? ” “ Hair , ” an upbeat rock musical , was performed by Rowan University ’ s Department of Theatre and Dance over the past two weekends .
Barefoot hippies graced the Tohill Theatre stage to sing about sexuality , war , drugs and racial tensions during the 1960s .

It seems fair to assume Tim Farron , the new Liberal Democrat leader , thinks gay sex is immoral .
They can be good Christians , or they can have a pleasurable sex life , but not both .
The key point is very simple : Farron thinks it is immoral for gay people to enjoy sex .
Even if it is purely symbolic , Farron 's belief that gay sex is immoral has real consequences .
Given Farron 's views on gay sex , I would not be particularly sorry to see him go .
Bastards is a noir in which money , sex and family come together in a perverse nexus of destruction .
Of money , sex and family , the one that is unexpectedly absent from Catherine Breillat ’ s new film Abuse of Weakness is sex .
Until now in Breillat ’ s filmography , there has been an equation between sexuality and the human body .
‘ The vulva is like the black hole of the universe ’ , wrote Breillat thirteen years ago , in the program notes accompanying the Toronto screening of her debut film Une vraie jeune fille ( 1975 ) , which was banned in France for twenty-five years .
Fille , as Breillat ’ s statement suggests , is about the awakening of the female sexual body , its fluids and secretions , and its interactions with the natural world .
But the human body explored by Abuse of Weakness is divorced from sexuality .

DIFFERENCES : SEXUAL SATISFACTION OF WOMEN Recent studies have found that sexually , circumcised men are different from intact men .
The glans or tip of the intact penis is more sensitive in nerves that give and receive messages from the brain .
A man is more able to 'control ' his sexual functioning when he remains intact .
Circumcision was initially introduced into this country by reformers who wanted to prevent masturbation , but according to recent studies , if this was the objective , the reformers have failed .
Research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that men who are circumcised are more likely to masturbate and to prefer certain sexual practices including oral sex and anal sex .
Sexuality meta-analysis studies show that circumcised men masturbate more frequently , and for longer durations , than their intact peers .
It is possible that the decrease in penile sensation that accompanies circumcision could be playing a role in the seeking of different sexual practices that offer more stimulation .
While they admit that parents and physicians have an ethical duty to act in a child 's best interest and well being , they fall far short of recommending that we have an ethical duty to leave a child 's genitals intact .

Three Colorado cities– Aspen , Boulder , and Denver–had enacted ordinances that listed “ sexual orientation ” as an impermissible ground for discrimination , equating the moral disapproval of homosexual conduct with racial and religious bigotry .
The phenomenon had even appeared statewide : the Governor of Colorado had signed an executive order pronouncing that “ in the State of Colorado we recognize the diversity in our pluralistic society and strive to bring an end to discrimination in any form , ” and directing state agency heads to “ ensure non discrimination ” in hiring and promotion based on , among other things , “ sexual orientation. ” Executive Order No .

In 1965 , another neuroendocrinologist at Oxford University , Geoffrey Harris further studied on the hypothalamus on rats and learned that xx rat exposed to y hormone had no ovulation while xy rat exposed to x hormone had ovulation .
Today , doctors don ’ t try to change sexual orientation .

There ’ s a huge amount of misinformation out there about why premature ejaculation occurs so let ’ s take a look at the most common premature ejaculation causes .
In my Last Longer Now program I will show you exactly how you can fight against every last one of these causes but for now , let ’ s briefly look at 4 or the main ones Lack of sexual skills and knowledge In our early teens , many young men discover masturbation and will generally go on to do quite a bit of it .
The problem is that more often than not we begin to masturbate while focusing completely on orgasm .
What this does is train and condition your body to reach orgasm faster and faster .
Then , by the time you begin having actual intercourse , your ejaculatory system has developed such a sensitive response system that the added stimulation means that everything is over much too soon .
Whether you like it or not , as far as your body is concerned sex is all about reproduction and ensuring your genes are passed on to the next generation .
It ’ s important to remember that premature ejaculation is very rarely due to psychological factors alone .
However , the way you handle your mindset , perceptions , and fears during sex can make a big difference to your performance in bed .
It is that you have never been taught how to control your sexual response during sex .

And frankly , that is the only thing the wealthy are really are scared of - that some day people will wake up and figure out that they do n't need to bite on shitty deals .
One thing I am learning over the last decade is that shitty financial deals really are n't that hard to spot .
The deal is , you can spot shitty deals a mile away just by the way they are presented .
Just about everything advertised on television , for example is a shitty deal .
This is not to say all deals aimed at the poor suck .
Anything that uses a high-pressure sales pitch is basically a shitty deal .

Last summer I had a client charged with rape in Twin Falls , but he wasn ’ t guilty and the prosecutor eventually DISMISSED the case and publicly proclaimed his innocence .
So off we go to an Air Force case in which three women claim to have been sexually assaulted by our client .
Another forensic lab located the video and audio that PROVED our client was telling the truth – the sexual contact with V1 was in fact consensual .
That charge was dismissed , but we still faced trial on two other “ victims. ” Over the course of a week long trial , V2 testified in a way that made admission of prior sexual acts with other unit members admissible .
V3 had prior sexual encounters with our client , and her testimony that this time was not consented was countered by other witness testimony substantiating our client ’ s claims .
Second – I actually like to put my client on the stand in sex cases because no matter what the judge instructs , the failure to testify usually is seen as “ proof ” of guilt by jurors .
My felony experience includes drug charges , sex offenses , aggravated assault and battery , murder , manslaughter , fraud , robbery , theft , and racketeering .

Lou Campbell ’ s PRUDE : A Hilarious and Vulnerable Journey from Toxic Conformity to Self-Affirmation By Sayak Sneddon-Ghosal “ I think there is a lot of shame surrounding sex .
The point of PRUDE is to take sex off this pedestal , ” says Campbell , a white , trans non-binary graysexual .
It focuses on sex and substance abuse .
PRUDE is a bespoke mirror that uses comedy to show us how much weight our society places on sex and sexuality .
It makes full use of its 18A rating , and this is no accident : Campbell “ wanted [ PRUDE ] to be so in your face that it became comical , because for so long I was pushing myself SO hard to perform sexuality the way I thought I was supposed to , the way I thought would make me the most fun and interesting person in the room. ” They “ wanted this intensity and effort to come across in the performance. ” It does — in spades .
And when the cracks appear in the King of the Party ’ s facade , that mirror trains itself on how confusing — and isolating — these sexual norms can be for asexual people .
“ But in a perfect world , ace ( a person on the spectrum of asexuality ) and allo ( allosexual : a person who experiences sexual attraction to others ) wouldn ’ t need to exist because people would just know everyone is different and has differing desire levels. ” Campbell recognizes the utility of such labels , but the intent of the King of the Party ’ s journey of self-revelation is to help all of us rise above our labels .
“ I want this show to push people to question compulsory sexuality , which is the idea that everyone is a sexual person or that sexual attraction is the norm in human interaction , ” says Campbell .

We know that kids are exposed to sex and relationships topics through the media , social media , the internet , school , kids in the playground , sexting and porn , which for many children and young people has become a default form of sex education .
Did you know that parents are the missing link in their children ’ s sex education ?
The idea is that parents talking openly at home about sex and relationships topics with their children helps with safeguarding , improves mental health and strengthens the parent-child connection .
It ’ s not surprising that we find it difficult to talk to our children about sex and relationships – most of us didn ’ t have much sex education ourselves or parents who talked openly with us .
Often parents are unaware of how important it is to take on the role of being their children ’ s sex educator – by the way , “ sex educator ” is a term that was used by the Department for Education in its sex-education guidance back in the year 2000 .
Unesco agrees , saying that parents “ play a primary role in shaping key aspects of their children ’ s sexual identity and their sexual and social relationships ” .
Parents and schools are actually young people ’ s top two preferred sources of information about sex and relationships .
Believe it or not , young people want to be able to get sexual information from their parents as well as insight into relationships and break-ups .
Most commonly parents have fears around their children ’ s emerging sexuality or of “ destroying their child ’ s innocence ” .
Parents often perceive sexual knowledge as something for adults only or that it ’ s not age appropriate for their kids .
But if you shelter children and young people and shield them from learning about sex and relationships , that maintains their ignorance , leaving them vulnerable to abuse and liable to seeking information from unreliable sources such as porn or their peers .
Right on target : an iconic image from How A Baby Is Made , the 1970s classic by Per Holm Knudsen There are all kinds of myths about sex education – for example that it encourages children to have sex .
But as we know from the example of Holland – which has world-class sex ed and where families are open about sex and relationships topics – teenagers tend to have lower rates of sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) and unwanted pregnancies – and they have delayed and mutually desired first-time sexual experiences , often under their parents ’ roof and with parental awareness .
When we did an online survey about parents and sex education , 91 % of women said that they were the parent most likely to talk to their children about sex and relationships .
This is true in the general population – even though there ’ s a growing awareness among some men that they need to engage with their children ( primarily about porn , they believe , and primarily with their sons ) they still tend to leave their wives to be the “ providers ” and “ gatekeepers ” of their children ’ s sex ed .
Question the imagery and media messaging about sex , sexuality , sexiness , gender stereotypes and the objectification of women that we all take for granted .
Cyberbullying has , over the past 5 years , been a top concern for young people , parents , educators and the media – but that ’ s now been overtaken by seeing harmful content – which includes violent images , racism , suicide , pressures to be very thin or to bulk up bodies and nude pictures .
Safeguarding definitely involves talking openly about porn .
There ’ s a generational disconnect in terms of parents ’ understanding of their children ’ s exposure to porn and their children ’ s lived experiences .
The British Board of Film Classification says that while 53 % of British children aged 11 to 13 have seen porn – some as young as age 7 – 75 % of their parents assume that their children have not seen it .
Whether children and young people unintentionally come across porn , are shown it by friends or actively search for it , they are being exposed to explicit and often extreme images before they are ready to process or relate to what they are seeing .
Watching porn raises concerns around body image , self-esteem , self-confidence , unrealistic expectations , harmful gender stereotypes , victim blaming , consent , pleasure and violence .
An estimated 88 % of mainstream porn features the degradation of women .
Talking openly about porn is the antidote to the detrimental impact that porn can have on children and young people ’ s attitudes , expectations and behaviour .
After all , they generally didn ’ t grow up with an endless supply of sexual images accessible on computers , laptops , iPads , PlayStations and mobile phones or with a “ porn production studio ” in their pocket .
With older children , do your best to demystify porn – that will play into their love of finding out about how things work and debunking misinformation .
You could talk about mainstream porn as an industry or the neuroscientific theories about watching porn or the impact of porn on attitudes , behaviour , desire , body image and self-esteem or why porn is not good sex ed .
PARENT-CHILD CONNECTION Basically a huge part of safeguarding your kids and improving their mental health involves having everyday conversations about sex , love , sexuality , changing bodies , the developing brain , body image , gender stereotypes , pleasure , consent and relationships .
If you ask them sex and relationships questions and listen non-judgmentally to their thoughts , feelings and experiences , you can turn the tables on who is the “ expert ” – it ’ s a kind of reverse-mentoring approach that empowers your children by your learning from them and a great way to strengthen your connection .

Some STDs can be prevented through abstinence from vaginal sex and oral sex .
You can also reduce your risk of getting an STD by using condoms and by avoiding vaginal sex .
Vaginal sex is especially risky without a condom .

Can cause HIV by having oral sex Getting HIV by having oral sex may seem like a simple idea , but there are several factors that can increase the risk of contracting the virus .
This can vary based on the type of oral sex , the type of partner , and the conditions surrounding the act .
HIV can enter the bloodstream through the mouth , urethra , and rectum .
It is more likely to be passed on through anal and vaginal sex , but oral sex is not as risky .
HIV transmission through oral sex is very rare , but can occur during oral sex .
This includes a mouth-to-penis sex called fellatio .
If you are HIV positive , you should avoid oral sex .
When you perform oral sex , your partner may have a mouth sore .

The Liberty of Sexual Commodification 45 Comments Posted by Brainpolice2 on June 20 , 2014 It seems that for some so-called feminists , especially the kind of feminism that some libertarians have found convenient to promote , sexualized sadism and masochism is female liberation .
We now have a celebrity “ Duke porn star ” who is using their choice to go into porn to help pay for their attendance at a prestigious private university as a rationale to promote libertarian arguments about the cost of higher education and privatizing schooling ( note the convenient plug to left-libertarian Sheldon Richman at the end ) , while also identifying and being held up by some as a feminist .
Things get extra odd if one investigates her work to find it to include a few examples of her being verbally humiliated and treated to sadistic sexual behavior , while her humiliator harkens to add the irony and snark of saying “ this is feminism 101 ” .
Out of one side of their mouths , many libertarian feminists want to wield rhetoric about patriarchy and misogyny , while out of the other side of their mouths they are ideologically focused on supporting hyper-sexuality even if it involves participation in and propagation of submissive female gender roles and the very culture of sexual violence that one simultaneously frequently hears feminists talk about .
Much of hardcore porn is more or less characterized by a fetishization of female submission to male sadism .
While it is one thing for libertarians to support the general legal status of porn , as is normal per their view , it ’ s an awkward and different matter when they take the next step to basically being committed to defending and enabling the culture of porn ( at least implicitly ) by framing it in terms of the liberty to consent to masochism or merely as a career choice on the market that those nasty state interventions get in the way of .
I think it may be the case that in the porn industry the lines of consent can blur as well .
But even if we do recognize that , in some sense those who participate in masochistic porn are consenting , it ’ s consensual nature becomes irrelevant as far as recognizing that it ’ s a symptom of a cultural problem .
It may be a decision made on the market , but it seems misleading if not bizarre to characterize it in terms of female liberation when it essentially propagates sexuality as a power play while reinforcing the idea that women are sexual objects .
For those who are ideologically committed to “ sex positivity ” , one is necessarily regressive if one criticizes the culture of hyper-sexuality .
It ’ s as for them one has a one-dimensional choice between their views and a socially conservative view – surely you must be a stuffy prude who is trying to stop others from having fun and opposes sex before marriage !
But what ’ s really going on is that some people recognize that the commodification of sexuality is a problem .
Perhaps both a culture of sexual repression and a culture of normalized sexual objectification have problems .
Maybe there ’ s a difference between genuinely free sexuality and the adoption of hyper-sexuality as a social norm or of sexuality on the market ; the sexual accessorizing of human beings as dispensable tools to use power on , and sexuality as a purchasable fantasy product .
This has probably produced an overall increase in the amount of people who have no idea how to have meaningful relationships , because their idea of relationships comes from media-generated fantasy or they are part of a dating market that thrives on short-term relationships mainly revolved around sexual gratification .
This does not mean I think we should normalize the repression of sexuality , but rather that we shouldn ’ t blindly promote it without considering its power .
I observe that the cultural move since the 60 ’ s toward unleashing previously repressed sexuality by going to the oppose extreme , in conjunction with market forces , has created a different problem of its own .
“ Porn star who is using their choice to go into porn to help pay for their attendance at a prestigious private university ” has been a stock go-to item for talk TV shows for literally decades .
Who is being used more thoroughly , the student whose role is as a thing for someone ’ s gratification , whose current career has a short shelf life , and a heavy social stigma ( and that can definitely close doors of opportunity based on “ morals clause ” type bullshit , even if , like me , you don ’ t believe in such bullshit ) ?
I do respect that sex work is way outside the comfort zone of many ( including myself ) and I generally resent that there should have to be “ hard choices ” of such magnitude as between hooking ( or whatever ) one ’ s way thru school and not going to school .
I certainly want a world whose range of non-sexual social settings has zero place for either domination or submission .
Seriously , if abolition of domination and submission is not the very definition of anarchism , then what the hell is ?
For all I know , maybe * DS * in sex play gets those impulses out of some people ’ s systems ( as some say violent video games might do for people ’ s violent impulses ) so they don ’ t have to bring them into places we all have to deal with , such as the workplace .
I do know that pathologization of sexual orientations and practices has personally bit me in the ass in significant and life-damaging ways and that one thing I will never do is question the legitimacy of the BDSM activities of consenting adults .
Likewise , I ’ m never going to stand in judgment over sex work as a career choice , with the caveat that my definition of choice is very exacting .
Basically , my take in sex work is a split decision because I ’ m pro-sex and anti-work .
Likewise , if it ’ s sex workers vs. the police , because I ’ m in opposition to all authority .
positive development , of course , but again , “ if you can ’ t beat ’ em join ’ em. ” My thoughts on the intersection between sex and money are summed up here .
The sex industry survives off of misogyny .
Granted , you will always see images of individuals engaged in sexual activity ( “ amateur porn ” ) but reducing the industry of porn/prostitution to such a thing is pretty much akin to reducing capitalism down to two individuals trading apples for bread .
Ignoring the fact that power relations are at play in sex doesn ’ t make those power imbalances go away .
So in regards to the sex industry , you have people who assume the only thing wrong with it is that women are shamed for going into it , and the solution is to thus change people ’ s public opinion about it rather than understanding how such an industry reproduces patriarchal values and furthers the commodification of female bodies .
Then you look at the number of sex workers with PTSD and other physical or mental conditions caused by the nature of their jobs .
Granted , I know of a handful of young women who have entered the sex industry on the basis that they assume lots of sex will “ empower ” them .
general of the sex workers ’ union in here in France has a Master ’ s Degree from the Sorbonne !
) , and had far more chances to avoid having to go into such an industry as the average prostitute , porn star , or stripper usually does .
So no , I don ’ t think it ’ s reasonable to point to the one happy hooker and prioritize her narrative above all others ’ .
One more thing : I question to what extent our culture is “ liberated ” in regards to sexuality just because we live in a porn culture .
Cultures that were/are far more repressive when it comes to sexuality ( i.e .
the Victorians , Islamic states ) saw “ sex ” everywhere too .
I would argue , it ’ s how we talk about sex that makes the difference .
nataliyapetrova July 3 , 2014 at 10:47 PM Straight or gay males can be porn actors or prostitutes .
In light of that ; how is hatred of women cruical to prostitution , pornography , and the sex industry generally ?
Are you opposed to all depictions of sex or just commodifed ones ?
And where is your evidence for many sex workers having physical or mental conditions caused by their jobs ?
I have known a woman who was far from rich who became an escort and still loves her work as far as I know .
Same for another person I know who I suspect is not middle class in income and engages in sex work .
I ’ ve de facto visited a prostitute and watched pornography in my life .
” how is hatred of women cruical to prostitution , pornography , and the sex industry generally ? ” Hardcore porn is based largely on fetishization of submission to male sadism .
So it does not at all seem like a leap to say that it ’ s based on hatred of women – when so much of it is based on using sexuality aggressively , getting one ’ s kicks by hurting women , and in foster the fantastical image of the woman as a bimbo who “ deserves ” to be “ punished ” through sexuality .
Since money is involved , it becomes an object of profit , as porn organizations as capitalist institutions are therefore incentived to make profit at all costs , no matter how much women are damaged in the process .
“ And where is your evidence for many sex workers having physical or mental conditions caused by their jobs ? ” Is this really a question ?
There are plenty of ex-pornstars who openly talk about the physical conditions they have to deal with because of their experience in porn .
Having watched plenty of hardcore pornography ; the notion that it ’ s generally sadistic in the sense of physical beatings or violent coercion or other things is absurd .
But even if true ; you ’ re conflating sex work and pornography with the current form it takes .
You can have a different kind of pornography or sex work that is not exploitiative .
As another poster posted ; this is not a settled question and many people who tout such claims have a bias against sex work in the first place .
The Lusty Lady was a worker owned strip club as one example .
I believe you misunderstand what I mean when I say it ’ s based on sadism .
Getting off on throat fucking with breath play is sadistic .
There is nothing “ bullshit ” about this .
“ But even if true ; you ’ re conflating sex work and pornography with the current form it takes .
You can have a different kind of pornography or sex work that is not exploitiative. ” I recognize the existence of “ different porn ” .
Anti-feminist sort-of-former sex worker FurryGirl on the empowered sex worker image ( NSFW ) : http : //www.feminisnt.com/2011/do-you-have-what-it-takes-to-be-an-empowered-sex-worker/ And on “ feminist porn ” : http : //www.feminisnt.com/2013/feminist-porn-isnt-a-branch-of-sex-workers-rights-its-an-obstacle/ Or take MRA GirlWritesWhat on why reclaiming ‘ slut ’ is pointless : http : //owningyourshit.blogspot.nl/2011/05/whats-in-word.html Noor , I think the designation “ sex-negative ” is largely artificial , and a term mainly created and weilded by sex-positives against * anyone who critisizes from within * .
I use it as roughly an umbrella term for anyone opposed to sex work generally on the basis of it being ‘ exploitative ’ , ‘ patriarchical ’ , or something along those lines , including feminists and traditional conservatives .
Treating issues of sex work as different from that of other work-related concerns , basically .
With conservative types pretty much all of them oppose sex work but with feminists the term sex-negative is more useful , though I do have a strong preference for the simple term ‘ anti-sex work ’ .
I would say I treat sex work the same as other work-related concerns , in that I reject the idea that we can ’ t criticize it or that it ’ s all hunky dory just because of the shallow “ consent ” of signing a contract .
But there is also a difference – sex work entails all the negative things that go along with conventional employment * plus * the very nature of the job being a matter of overt sexual exploitation .
At another level , I also criticize sex work insofar as the women involved obviously have a warped psychology .
When we ’ re not talking about sex slavery , and the context is largely middle class white women , this is not something that people choose to do in the absence of psychological problems and abusive histories .
I think that it ’ s ridiculous to react to an analysis of the psychological context of this as simply a matter of “ sex negative ” busybodies who can ’ t stand the thought of other people being kinky .
How would you know this about sex workers and especially all sex workers ?
I knew a sex worker with a history of abuse , but she also told me it helped her work through it .
You don ’ t own a person ’ s body in sex work nor use it in that exploitiative sense .
Sex workers do and can set rules or limits to what they are willing to do just like non-commercial sexual interaction .
“ You don ’ t own a person ’ s body in sex work nor use it in that exploitiative sense .
Sex workers do and can set rules or limits to what they are willing to do just like non-commercial sexual interaction. ” The moment you sign a contract , you are binding yourself to rules and obligations , and in effect signing away some of your liberty .
This applies to sex work as much as it applies to more normal jobs .
You ’ re obviously poorly informed about this issue , and have a desire to believe the worst about sex work ( for whatever reason ) .
Your concerns may be valid in black market sex work — I don ’ t know as much about that — but you ’ re so far off in regards to porn and legal prostitution that it ’ s painful .
You sound like someone who has uncritically accepted every negative claim about sex work they ’ ve stumbled across .
I don ’ t see how my concerns don ’ t apply , in addition to black market sex work , to the sadistic depths of hardcore porn .
This is a naive young girl who is basically a pawn in a publicity game , and who can not be taken at face value when claiming that * some of the most denigrating porn out there * is “ liberating ” and immune from critique just because it ’ s a choice .
If you haven ’ t worked in the sex industry , and you aren ’ t basing this on something you ’ ve read , then your “ experiences , observations and thoughts ” don ’ t add up to much .
But most feminists don ’ t do any kind of sex work , and they can be just as clueless as you are .
This seems a lot more exploitative than any porn work she ’ s done .
I ’ m also not arguing that shooting porn is liberating– it ’ s basically just a job .
I am arguing against your characterization of the porn industry .
It flies in the face of research and first-hand accounts given by porn actors/actresses .
Sometimes I don ’ t enjoy my job either , doesn ’ t mean I was sexually abused as a child and now I ’ m punishing myself ( or whatever the story is ) .
“ It flies in the face of research and first-hand accounts given by porn actors/actresses. ” What of all the first-hand accounts by those porn actresses who speak out against the industry ?
I see the possibility in porn for this entrapment to basically amount to something extra horrific for those who want out .
Hell , construction work entails more direct use of the physical body than some sex work jobs , like phone sex operating .
All that the experiences of unhappy sex workers prove that it isn ’ t a perfect job , much less so for everyone , and much more so when affected by capitalism , global disparities , and culture .
I think you ’ ll have a nearly impossible time trying to find anyone , especially a sex worker , saying that anyone can or should do it .
“ At another level , I also criticize sex work insofar as the women involved obviously have a warped psychology .
When we ’ re not talking about sex slavery , and the context is largely middle class white women , this is not something that people choose to do in the absence of psychological problems and abusive histories. ” I think you may be mistaken in this BP .
While I do not think it is appropriate to go by a single study , the fact there is clear contrary evidence is cause to question blanket claims on the psychology of sex workers .
From the abstract : “ The damaged goods hypothesis posits that female performers in the adult entertainment industry have higher rates of childhood sexual abuse ( CSA ) , psychological problems , and drug use compared to the typical woman .
The present study compared the self-reports of 177 porn actresses to a sample of women matched on age , ethnicity , and marital status .
Comparisons were conducted on sexual behaviors and attitudes , self-esteem , quality of life , and drug use .
Porn actresses were more likely to identify as bisexual , first had sex at an earlier age , had more sexual partners , were more concerned about contracting a sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) , and enjoyed sex more than the matched sample , although there were no differences in incidence of CSA .
In terms of psychological characteristics , porn actresses had higher levels of self-esteem , positive feelings , social support , sexual satisfaction , and spirituality compared to the matched group .
A discriminant function analysis was able to correctly classify 83 % of the participants concerning whether they were a porn actress or member of the matched sample .
That ’ s one sex worker .
It ’ s all the one sex worker being held up as a libertarian icon by Cathy Reisenwitz and being used as part of a PR campaign for libertarianism , so she is most relevant to my critique .
My main contention is that the kind of identity politics involved in the libertarian defenses of sex work over focuses on individual choice in such a way that bars the matter from any real critique of the social dynamics the phenomena takes place in – we ’ re apparently not allowed to observe the cultural problem it takes place within , we ’ re just supposed to support individual choice without thinking about it .
I think you mentioned there was one porn actress who didn ’ t like it earlier .
3 ) “ conservative prude ” This actually is a conservative position on porn and sexuality .
You can only hold to a position that sex work ‘ uses ’ a person ’ s body in a separate sense from other work , if you believe sexuality is something ‘ sacred ’ .
I ’ m not calling you one , but I ’ m saying you do hold to one of their basic premises , which really isn ’ t very far from saying that sex should be only between people who love each other or are married .
If you accept “ fuck buddies ” , two people mutually ‘ exploiting ’ each other , the only real difference that remains is an issue of money being exchanged .
If that ’ s where the problem lies , then it ’ s not the sex aspect , it ’ s only the work-for-money aspect that you ’ re opposed to .
Laura Agustin and others have written plenty on this and they ’ ve actually talked to sex workers in third-world countries , who still choose to do it , and how feminists are pushing them into doing even worse-paid sweatshop-factory labor because that ’ s deemed ‘ better ’ than sex work .
Saying sex workers all have warped psychologies is a pretty fucking broad generalization also .
You seem to buy into the bullshit myths made up by the anti-sex work assclenches , both traditionalist and feminist .
Contrary to popular opinion , most sex workers in the West are neither $ 5 hookers nor six-figure luxury escorts , but somewhere in between .
And as far as criticism of wage labor , sex workers in the West have more freedom , many being basically self-employed , than people do in other wage jobs .
“ You can only hold to a position that sex work ‘ uses ’ a person ’ s body in a separate sense from other work , if you believe sexuality is something ‘ sacred ’ . ” I ’ m sorry Noor , but this is a red herring to what you want to focus on .
This has nothing to do with any notion of sexuality being something sacred .
It has to do with the fact that the very nature of the job is submission to the sexual use of one ’ s body .
“ That ’ s a conservative traditionalist premise. ” I think both you and sex-positive feminists erect a strawman in making a dichotomy between a liberal-capitalist acceptance of sex work and conservative ethics .
” I ’ m not calling you one , but I ’ m saying you do hold to one of their basic premises , which really isn ’ t very far from saying that sex should be only between people who love each other or are married. ” I hold to no such premise .
“ If you accept “ fuck buddies ” , two people mutually ‘ exploiting ’ each other , the only real difference that remains is an issue of money being exchanged. ” Sex work is not fuck buddies + money .
It is not merely consenting to sex outside a relationship with money involved , nor is it merely a private interaction relationship between those directly involved .
You can ignore the social reality of sex work if you want , but I personally am annoyed by your ignorance .
“ Submission to the sexual use of one ’ s body ” Take out the “ sexual ” and you have a critiicism of wage labor and/or all work .
That you can not treat sex work as different from similar work if you do not believe ‘ sex ’ is something ‘ special ’ or ‘ sacred ’ .
This is far too vague and overstated , and I don ’ t really think you ’ re capable of examining the complex system of sex work from the armchair position you ’ re in .
I can say that everything you say is , in fact , contributing to institutional forces that further marginalize sex workers , resulting in sex work being less legal , thus decreasing their chances of being able to safely report crimes and such .
I am not “ phobic ” of either “ trans ” or “ whore ” .
Hence , the Christian homeschooler and the sex worker , who may seem to have little in common at first glance , are more than likely than not to both fit well within libertarianism .
As opposed to the real thing , I suppose — someone who during their time in the libertarian movement was ( by numerous , mutually corroborating horrified accounts ) a dudebro engaged in serial sexual harassment , and went from there to the kind of born-again SWERFY-TERFY radfeminism that champs at the bit to restrict women ’ s agency “ for their own good ” ?
The white male savior complex is no less repulsive than the guy who went around screaming “ Splooge ! ” Most of the “ splooge ! ” stuff came off as that of a sexually liberal but extremely socially awkward guy .
Are people able to make criticism about sexual culture without being characterized as actively trying to control other people ’ s sex lives ?
If someone criticizes sex work as culturally problematic and links it to the problems of capitalism , that doesn ’ t necessarily mean they are “ trying to restrict women ’ s agency ” .
The basic idea here is that it is nonsensical to wield rhetoric about patriarchy while actively participating in and promoting things that propagate sex as a commodity and fetishizes submission to the more violent aspects of sexuality .
The real dudebros I know wouldn ’ t even make a shallow attempt to come to grips with and think about feminism – they think it ’ s all bullshit .
There are white male saviors who get into feminism – and I know of quite a few of them in the left-libertarian movement , and they ’ re by and large not people who are critical of sex positive feminism ( of course , sex positive feminism benefits them ) .
Or those who hang around Cathy Reisenwitz and suck up to her .
Or those who get into polyamory as a scheme to fuck all the radical women while maintaining double standards in their relationships .
They * love * the idea of women adopting a kind of feminism that ’ s all about celebrating sexual promiscuity – because that ’ s the kind of feminism that plays into male sexual fantasy neatly .
Pointing out how the sex industry furthers a culture of patriarchy is hardly “ saving ” the privileged white college-educated women who enter prostitution merely because they enjoy fucking .
Since when have radical feminists EVER tried to exclude sex workers ?
These dudes will constantly apologize for the shitty things women do and say which contributes to our oppression under patriarchy , or they ’ ll try to convince women that fucking lots of dudes will enable us to overcome whatever sexual repression we face .
It ’ s hard not to see statements that sex workers are all psychologically damaged , as seeing them as all victims in need of ‘ saving ’ .
So SWERFs aren ’ t a thing because they ’ ve always accepted former sex workers who now agree with them .
It should not be taboo to talk of the problematic social-psychological trappings around commodified sex , whether legal or illegal .
I do not hate or fear sex workers .
I don ’ t think anyone here has been resorting to “ sex work is voluntary , that ’ s all , shut up on criticizing it ” .
What you are being called out on , are the assumptions that sex work is inherently more exploitative than other work due to the ‘ sex ’ part , and that only a damaged psyche can ever get one to do sex work today .
Homophobes actually like to resort to a “ hate the game , not the player ” which is what you ’ re basically doing right now with sex work .
I absolutely do criticize conditions where people are made to do sex work when they are not comfortable with it , but I see those as issues of current statist and capitalist structures , that also result in people in sweatshops and such .
The closest to ‘ taboo ’ is when you make unfalsifiable and ignorant statements about a good portion of people and even then you ’ re not being called out because of norms on what is ‘ socially acceptable ’ , you ’ re getting called out for the bullshit .
I suppose one could make a case that some sex work is more directly involved with the body ( ignoring that penetrative sex for cash is only one of many fields of sex work , and that sex work is defined not by how directly it is involved with the physical body , but more on using one ’ s sexual labor to turn others on ) but one would have to argue jobs like beekeeping and food tasting is extra exploitative as well .
Food tasting directly involves the physical body , as opposed to some types of sex work like phone sex or cam modeling .

On one hand , according to Morris and Zeevi , Islam did played a major role in the three waves of violence : “ The perpetrator– those who went out to invade and plunder Christian homes , killing the inhabitants with axes and knives and raping women– were motivated by the Islamic belief that they were killing infidels deemed dangerous to Islam and the empire. ” Asked if he believed the driving force behind the campaigns was nationalism rather than religion , Morris conceded that nationalism did play significant driving role in the persecutions , especially during the Ataturk period where “ making a uniform Turkish society meant getting rid of diversity ; in other words , the Christians. ” …

The Untold Dangers Of Masturbation fadminon 19/03/2018 Leave a Comment on The Untold Dangers Of Masturbation Masturbation is not a subject that is discussed in daylight but , many people indulge in it privately and it is therefore important to know the dangers of masturbation as well as its negative and positive effects on your health .
Masturbation is a term used to refer to the self-stimulation of genital organs , by both men and women , in most cases , to the point of getting an orgasm .
According to health experts , “ forty per cent of adolescent girls , and between sixty and ninety per cent of boys in this age group take part in regular masturbation. ” For most youngsters , masturbation provides them with the chance to explore sexually in private , before they can make the decision to engage in sexual activities with other people .
Given the fact that the world is currently filled with all kinds of diseases and conditions , masturbation is considered to be the safest type of sex , when it comes to helping prevent the transmission of diseases , such as HIV .
Consequently , abusive masturbation can harm the male and female body in the following ways : infection , mood swings and stress , fatigue , insomnia and sleep disturbance , weak or soft erections , premature ejaculations that is sometimes accompanies by excessive precum , fuzzy vision or eye floaters , performance anxiety attacks , discomfort or pain in the lower back , thinning hair , insulin resistance and suppressed immunity , testicular pain and pain in the groin .
Even though masturbation may at times be recommended by doctors to assist patients with their sexual lives , it also poses some dangers .
A new study has shown that men who masturbate on a frequent basis are at risk of developing prostate cancer .
For women , it has been noted that frequent masturbation may lead to them not enjoying sexual sessions with their partners .
Most women claim that the orgasms they derive from their own touch tend to be more intense as compared to those that they get from engaging in sex .
Female Masturbation Side Effects As a woman , even if you do not happen to be addicted to sex , too much masturbation may lead to unfortunate physical consequences .
Due to over stimulation , your G-spot , vagina , and clitoris could lose sensitivity , and this may make it more susceptible to injuries and infections .
It is a condition known as sexual exhaustion .
While looking at the masturbation effects on health , experts have noted that frequent masturbators will in many cases have a problem when it comes to performing with their real-life sex partners .
As such , the women no longer regard sex sessions as shared experiences .
In a woman , it is something that can lead to an inability to reach sexual orgasm as well as lead to complete lack of sexual desire .
Mitochondria fatigue and masturbation : It is normal for you to experience fatigue after you have had an orgasm .
Getting enough sleep , as well as making sure that you reduce your frequency of masturbation will assist in alleviating the exhaustion that you are experiencing .
In cases where masturbation does not lead to significant problems such as mitochondria fatigue and sexual exhaustion , masturbating too often may still cause problems to your relationships .
Male masturbation side effects Having looked at the effects , it has on the female body ; let us look at the masturbation effects on health , when practiced by men .
Given that masturbation is a noxious habit , men regularly practice it across the globe .
Today , it is a practice that has corrupted the life of many young men , with many taking part in regular , or daily masturbation sessions .
In a bid to understand the masturbation effects on health , experts looking into this topic found that men are controlled by three main factors : environmental , emotional , and hormonal factors .
If looking for information on masturbation effects on health , it is important to note that too much masturbation may lower your sperm count .
As such , it is recommended that couples trying to start a family desist from masturbation , as it may prove to be counterproductive .
How to stop masturbation for men and women Having looked at the masturbation effects on health discussed above , you may feel the need to stop the habit completely , or reduce the frequency with which you masturbate .
Taking part in new activities brings with it new excitement , which will help you resist the urge to masturbate .
To achieve this , you can try the following : be creative , take part in sports , eat a balanced and healthy diet , make sure you get adequate sleep , make a plan to avoid masturbating during your go-to times of each day , if you find your bathing time to be tempting , switch from taking warm showers , and start taking cold showers .
• Limit your isolation , if the reason you masturbate frequently is because you have a lot of time alone , try to find ways in which you can become socially engaged .
• Stop the urge to watch porn .
On a final note , trying to stop masturbation is not something that can be accomplished within a single day .

This government-sponsored sexual assault needs to be stopped .
Jeff , that is very much what this feels like to me : government-sanctioned sexual assault .
In the four days of the hearings for Jackson ’ s nomination , senators on the Judiciary Committee used the words “ child porn , ” “ pornography , ” and “ pornographer ” 165 times .
They used some version of “ sex ” ( “ sexual assault , ” “ sex crimes , ” and so on ) 142 times .
They said “ pedophile ” 15 times and “ predators ” 13 times , one time more than the Bill of Rights came up .
That pattern continued today as senators made statements before their votes suggesting that Jackson had done all she could to turn those who commit sex crimes against children loose on the country .
With their focus on sex crimes against children , Republicans are openly courting the QAnon vote , even though Republican words do not always seem to match their actions .
We learned today that Florida governor Ron DeSantis delayed the release of public records involving a Florida state official , Halsey Beshears , who is linked to the underage sex crimes investigation in that state .
The implications of the focus on sex crimes against children are larger than the next election , though .
In Florida , Governor Ron DeSantis on March 28 signed a bill banning kindergarten through third-grade public school teachers from talking about sexual orientation or gender identity , a measure its opponents have dubbed the “ Don ’ t Say Gay ” law .
This has pushed them into the camp of authoritarians , and they are using fears of sexual attacks on children to win support for that authoritarianism .
[ Governor Ron DeSantis ] , you are onto something ! ” Pushing Orbán ’ s voters yesterday was a referendum on the ballot that included questions like : “ Do you support the unrestricted exposure of underage children to sexually explicit media content that may affect their development ? ” DeSantis ’ s spokesperson Christina Pushaw tweeted : “ Love the referendum idea .
] ” Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene also applauded Orbán ’ s approach to “ sex ed ” and tweeted : “ Congratulations to Viktor Orban on winning a victory well deserved !

In the same way , Jesus tells us , “ But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife , except for sexual immorality , makes her the victim of adultery , and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery ” ( Matthew 5:32 ) .
Jesus tells us in this passage of Scripture that anyone who divorces their wife or husband for any reason besides sexual immorality is committing a sin .
If the married couple chooses to get a divorce , it can only be under the means of either the man or woman committing sexual immorality by being unfaithful to their spouse .
If a person divorces for any reason outside of sexual immorality or abuse , it is a sin ; however , this sin will not cause a person to go to hell when they die .

Let ’ s consider an example : A manager who wants to retain an employee falsely tells a prospective employer that the employee consistently underperforms and has been disciplined for making inappropriate sexual remarks to a coworker .
Intimate partner violence ( IPV ) is broadly defined as the psychological , physical , or sexual victimization of a partner within an intimate relationship ( Edwards & Slyaska , 2015 ) .
Similar problems have been reported in colleges ; a third of students have reported experiencing either sexual or physical IPV ( Scherer et al. , 2014 ) .
IPV victimization in women has been associated with a greater likelihood of contracting sexually transmitted infections , HIV ( Overstreet et al. , 2015 ) , and cardiovascular disease .
This could be due to sexual exploitation experienced by victims of IPV , and engaging in other high-risk behaviors , like poor diet , exercise , and smoking ( Campbell et al. , 2008 ; Halpern et al. , 2017 ) .

( protesters holding placards reading : “ Acquittal of Smith is a collusion between US and Philippine governments. ” ) The Philippine Court of Appeals overturned the ruling , indicating the sexual act was consensual .
What Gloria is doing is saddening and unfathomable because now Filipino women have no protection in their own country. ” ( VOICEOVER ) : In March , Nicole , the woman who accused Smith of rape altered her testimony and emigrated to the United States in a dramatic twist in the case , saying she was no longer certain that a crime had taken place .
In the lower court , In proving rape against Smith , the prosecution had shown the evidence that Nicole was too drunk to have consensual sex when she was with Smith on the night of November 1 , 2005 .
The appeals court found that it wasn ’ t rape , but a spontaneous , unplanned romantic episode stirred by alcoholic drinks .
The reversal sets a discouraging precedent for other rape complainants , Ursua said .

Chambers , who is married to wife Leslie and has spoken openly about his sexual attraction to men , said last year that he was trying to distance his ministry from the notion that it could `` cure '' a homosexual orientation .
A year ago , Chambers had already publicly backed away from the notion that the organization could cause someone to change his or her sexual orientation .
ET NPR 's John Burnett reports that in an television interview last year , Chambers said that 99.9 percent of gay people who go through therapy to change their sexual orientation never are able to do it .
In my view , hearing someone say they hope to reach an agreement is like hearing someone say they hope to have sex .

I ’ d love to hear about your experience of turning from poetry to prose , and whether it made it easier to break the taboo of writing so intimately and directly about sex ?
Having an episodic and disjunctive structure was in my comfort zone and it allowed me to foreground the character ’ s twinned preoccupations with sex and inner experience , which cause the rest of the world and life to exist only in the periphery of her consciousness .
I ’ ve written my fair share of erotic poetry , but have never written so directly and transgressively about sex ( or anger or disappointment or humiliation ) as I did in The Widening .
One of the questions I get most often is “ Why does Molly [ the main character in Dogs ] have sex with so many different people ?
But the truth is , setting aside the question of my resemblance to Molly , the sex in Dogs is as much a metaphor for Molly ’ s longing and blindness as it is actually about sex .
With one important exception , what leads her to sex isn ’ t passion or desire or any kind of awakening .
Although she keeps her sex life hidden from her family , being promiscuous is her way of being the kind of girl her father , who respects only prostitutes , would be proud of .
CAROL : There ’ s a wonderful sentence at the end of Dogs , where Molly reflects that she ’ s “ grown up in the empty spaces of my father ’ s heart , taken shape from all that he was missing. ” It ’ s interesting how the fictional fathers in both books shape our characters ’ sexual acting out .
It is an open question why she takes the word so hard , but I think it is because it implies not just multiple sexual partners and a moral laxity but a lack of discriminating judgment .
Like “ slut ” which she and her friends proudly use to describe themselves .
She has never heard anyone use “ promiscuous ” in a negative sense , and in her mind , having innumerable sexual partners means being immeasurably cool .
That ’ s what I mean about her not really being interested in sex for its own sake—and yet the sexual component of Dogs has been a real live-wire for readers , and I don ’ t mean to be coy about the effect of using sex metaphorically .
I ’ m thinking of when Molly says “ I didn ’ t know how to talk to men in any neutral matter-of-fact way. ” Both Molly and the girl in The Widening are so conscious of the sexual potential of any encounter that they are virtually and sometimes comically incapable of interacting with boys and men without sexualizing a situation .
I ’ m interested in the idea of girls using sex and sexuality to express or act out ideas about life and society , which is what both our characters implicitly do .
ABIGAIL : I do think it ’ s so interesting that both our characters worry about how much they ’ re feeling or not feeling sexually , how , as you say , they have “ too much sensibility to balance or handle. ” Both are such keen observers of their own thoughts and emotions , even as they fail to understand themselves .
The scenes with her mother around her journal—both the initial violation and then the equally horrifying gift of the new journal—are so powerful , and seem to me every bit as central to the novel as the character ’ s sexual awakening and exploration .
It is her conduit to self-understanding , and to seeing herself as more than a sexualized being while at the same time accepting her sexual self .
ABIGAIL : Do you think there ’ s a connection between sex and writing ?
I ’ m embarrassed to admit that sometimes sex elicits from me the desire to write–right then–certain little phrases pop up and I ’ m torn between getting my notebook out or just trying to remember them for later or just letting them go .
I also think that both writing and sex took me a longer time to grow into than I expected or than I was ready to admit to : I wanted each to flow more naturally , more easily than either did .
One of the scenes that struck me most powerfully in The Widening was the scene when the character touches herself and has her first orgasm .
The first time I read it , it made me uncomfortable , which is funny , because Molly ’ s earliest sexual feelings are for a dog—but when I read it again , it seemed one of the strongest scenes in the book , and it occurred to me that a lot of the sex that ’ s all around us in the popular media and even in some very literary books isn ’ t especially naked , or even meant to be .
I was reading a wonderful Aimee Bender story the other day in which a librarian has sex with 6 men in one day , but the point of the sex is that it ’ s dissociative , and so , even when the librarian asks to be fucked like a dog and Bender describes the penis ramming inside her , I don ’ t know that readers would be embarrassed .
I ’ m curious whether you agree that true nakedness makes people more uncomfortable than the simple mechanics of intercourse , and also if there were parts of my book that made you uneasy at first .
I ’ m pleased that it is an honest and nuanced attempt to imaginatively enter into a young woman ’ s unresolved and messy experience of her early sexuality , and to write in a head-on way , without apology , reservations or rationalizing explanations , about the vulnerability , irresponsibility and sense of lostness which that can imply .
Molly too is more concerned about men ’ s feelings than her own , and I found myself thinking of her as a temple prostitute , a tradition that existed in India of women who gave men sexual favors in the temple as a sacred act .
After I finished it , it occurred to me that college women might relate to it , that it might even be appropriate for women ’ s studies literature courses , because of the way it deals head-on with emerging female sexuality and cultural norms .

Getting wet… horny for him… again .
I remembered the weight of him , as he took me , his body pressing down on me , legs gripping me tightly , pulling me back against his cock as he pumped it into me… his cock ! … I wanted his cock again… to feel it parting my pussy , in my pussy , throbbing… no ! , I was throbbing… I was wet for him ! , for it .
I kept imagining how it would be , this time… the next time , the time after that… His cock inside me , again , as he pumped it into my body , hard , like before… only better… better… better than anything… The hardest part of trying to resist how I felt now , was that it had been what I had wanted… freedom… to do what I wanted… not constrained .
When I looked at him now , his deep brown eyes held mine without recrimination… mesmorized me… made me think about it… Hard dog cock , hard dog fuck , hard to resist the thought of it… pump , pump , pump , pump… taking the dog , doing the dog , fucking the dog , loving the feel of the dog… so different , so good ! … I ’ d felt so free , so ME ! , when I had been under the dog !
I could be a dirty bitch , so much easier with the dog… didn ’ t feel the need to act any differently… he didn ’ t mind when I ’ d begged him to fuck me like a bitch , he was already doing that !
Fill my cunt ! … Yes ! , I love you ! .
Tonight ! … I would let the dog fuck me again , tonight !
Balls slapping , pussy stretching , cock-tapping good… as the dog went into overdrive… Reaming me , filling me , squirting inside me , as I gasped and groaned at the way he took me… Bigger , bigger , bigger , bigger !
So fucking big !
Fuck me , fuck me , fuck me ! … yeah ! … fuck me like that !
I whimpered as he drove it way up inside , with no care whatsoever , punishing me , hurting me , fucking me like a bitch !
Do it , do it , do it ! … do it to me ! , you dirty bastard !
Feeling the pummeling all the way through my body , closing my eyes as my head bobbed up and down… focused on how good his cock felt , on what it was doing to me… so fucking big and heavy… both his huge piece of meat and his body !
Now my muscles were gripping him too , now I was the one losing control , now I was the one doing the fucking , now I was fucking him with complete abandon .
Enjoying using him , his body , his sex , now my needs were seen to and sated… squeezing my tit ’ s as I felt my orgasm all the way through me… better than ever before !
nothing ! … nothing… Covered in his come and fur , smelling the blend of dog and woman sex , I went and showered myself clean .
My mind was free of the horniness that had been building up in me… I could think clearly now… Confessions of a West Palm Slut – Daylight Fading ( Chapter 5 ) Turning of housewife into a sex slave

Duchamp 's brothers were n't the only ones riled by the artist 's take on the nude tradition .
Looking back on the Armory Show 's impact on its 100th anniversary , curator Marilyn Kushner explained , `` If you saw a female nude , in art , in sculpture or painting , it was very classical .
To see a nude woman fractured and in motion in such a way was beyond jarring to the 1913 crowds who flocked to gawk at the exhibition .
Addressing what he later called “ the problem of motion in painting , ” Marcel Duchamp here repeats elements of the nude ’ s body in her final steps down a precipitous spiral staircase .

The most remarkable symptom of lymphatic filariasis is elephantiasis – edema with thickening of the skin and core tissue which is marked by severe swelling in the arms , legs , breasts , or genitals .
The parasite infects the lymph nodes and blocks the flow of lymph throughout the body ; this results in chronic lymphedema , most often noted in the lower torso ( typically in the legs and genitals ) .

In addition , he asserted that the organization violates the Arab-Islamic norms of Tunisian society because it advocates and defends sodomy , which is a criminal act under Chapter 230 of the Penal Code .
It also prohibits them from advocating or involvement in violence , hatred , intolerance and discrimination on religious , sexual or regional grounds .
After addition judicial procedures and postponements , Hedhili challenged that ruling on Feb. 20 , 2019 , on the grounds that the association ’ s bylaws state that its goal is to defend sexual minorities , which , he said , is inconsistent with “ the Islamic values of Tunisian society , which rejects homosexuality and prohibits such inappropriate behavior , ” on the basis of Chapter 230 of the penal code .
Speaking to Al-Monitor , Shams executive director Bouhdid Belhedi called the ruling in favor of the association “ a victory for the individual rights and freedoms and the civil character of the state established in the country ’ s constitution. ” He lamented the long , drawn out attempt by the government “ maliciously ” trying to stop Sham ’ s activities , noting that the association ’ s objective is to support sexual minorities “ providing financial , emotional and psychological assistance and securing them a safe environment , regardless of their sexual orientation. ” Belhedi stressed that the association will work to abolish Chapter 230 of the Penal Code , which calls for three years in prison for people convicted of sodomy .
He also said that Shams , in coordination with human rights organizations , seeks to abolish the practice of authorities ordering “ anal examinations ” for men arrested on suspicion of having had same-sex sexual relations .
In October 2018 , a number of MPs had spoken about coordinating with civil associations in drafting a law decriminalizing homosexuality and prohibiting anal examinations , but no such law has been presented for consideration .
Hmida stressed that the decision is a positive first step in that efforts at decriminalizing homosexuality and abolishing anal examinations can now be pursued within the framework of the jurisprudence of that case .

She joins me this week to share everything you need to know about menopause and your sexual health .
Tune in this week as we dive deeper into sex and menopause , the impact of hormones – both systemic and vaginal – and some of the health impacts you might experience as a result of menopause .
Ready to start the new year with a new , sexually empowered YOU ?
The two top reasons menopausal women stop having sex .
We talk so much about menopause and sex .
And we definitely have sexual health people come in and talk to us about sex during and after menopause and what exactly that looks like and how we can make sure that we ’ re all getting the pleasure that we love and deserve .
So I ’ m bringing this concept back to the forefront around sex and menopause and also letting you know that it ’ s something that we definitely address in Own Your Sexuality Now .
And today we are going to be talking about sex and menopause .
And I started getting into female sex med a couple of years ago after a very kind of monumental ground shaking patient that came into my office .
And how we kind of take care of our bodies and is it true that we stop having sex after menopause ?
And here ’ s our talk today on menopause , sex and GSM .
Menopause , sex and GSM .
Kelly : GSM is the new title of vulva vaginal atrophy .
So it used to be called vulva vaginal atrophy , and people said they didn ’ t like the atrophy word .
So genital urinary syndrome of menopause is an entire mouthful but it was created to replace vulva vaginal atrophy .
So people don ’ t even know that my burning with urination , my frequent recurrent urinary tract infections , my vaginal dryness , maybe it ’ s more difficult to be aroused or have an orgasm , or pain with sex , or tightness of the vagina .
And I don ’ t know about you but there ’ s so many clients that come to me as a sex coach and they are mad .
Because I see a lot of women right now , they stopped having sex 10 years ago because of this .
And I ’ m like , if I can get to the 47 year old who ’ s having a great sex life .
But if you really want to prevent the recurrent UTIs , the burning with peeing , the frequency or urination , the dry painful vulva vagina .
The atrophy or loss of labia minora , clitoral phimosis , where the clitoris kind of shrinks and the clitoral hood kind of comes over and gets almost scarred down .
This is like vitamin E for your vagina and vulva region .
Kelly : So the bladder has estrogen receptors in it , what I call the bladder and the vagina condo mates , they share a wall .
So I tell a lot of people , “ We ’ re putting estrogen in your vagina but it ’ s actually for your bladder. ” That ’ s how I kind of get them over like , “ Why am I putting this here for that ? ” I ’ m like , “ Shares the same wall , the bladder gets the estrogen. ” The bladder again loves having estrogen around and it misbehaves , it gets a little overactive .
And then also the outside the urethra and that skin around the vulva can get thin .
And I have to say that earlier when you were talking about phimosis and the clitoris shrinking .
I was shedding a tear , the thought of a clitoris shrinking was just making me so sad .
I always have my little 3D model of the clitoris , Goldie , she ’ s just so important to me .
So tell me a little bit more about the estrogen and menopause and why is my clitoris shrinking ?
Kelly : Well , just like all the other structures down there , it became a clitoris because it saw estrogen and it thrives with estrogen around it .
So there ’ s skin , just like foreskin on a penis , there is foreskin of the clitoris , we call it the clitoral hood .
And it can kind of become adherent or attached to the top of the clitoris .
Sonia : Well , that is one big clitoris .
And you can on exam , by somebody who ’ s skilled at looking at the head of the glans of the clitoris you can see how much phimosis that that clitoris has .
And if we think about the fact , I know that I advocate and I believe that you also advocate for the fact of sex and sexual intimacy throughout the lifespan and pleasure , especially for women throughout their lifespan .
This is ensuring that your vulva and your vagina is healthy enough to engage in pleasurable intimacy .
Kelly : Yeah , absolutely , even for people who aren ’ t currently vaginally sexually active .
Because I ’ ll get a lot of women , and like I said , I meet them , they stopped having sex 10 years ago because it was painful .
And they tell me , they say , “ I don ’ t need to be on that because I ’ m not sexually active , I don ’ t have a partner. ” And it irritates me because I ’ m like , “ I ’ m not doing anything for your partner .
This is for you , whether you have a partner or not , this is for you. ” So a lot of people defer , “ I don ’ t need to put something in my vagina because I don ’ t have a partner. ” And it ’ s like , “ No , no , this is about you and taking care of you. ” Sonia : Yeah .
I think that that ’ s such an important thought , is just that in our society , it ’ s almost like the vagina is not a part of a woman ’ s body , it ’ s like it ’ s out for rent or something like that .
And this concept that we don ’ t necessarily , if we ’ re not utilizing it then we don ’ t need to necessarily keep the maintenance up because there ’ s not somebody else that needs to utilize the vagina .
As opposed to it ’ s about us , it ’ s about our health , it ’ s about our pleasure , whether we ’ re going to have penetrative sex or whatever .
There ’ s women that like to just stimulate their clitoris , but there ’ s also women that will also penetrate and stimulate themselves at the same time , so whatever it is .
And I think part of that too is women don ’ t know or we ’ re not taught the importance of the vagina in pelvic health .
That the vagina actually it plays a role in preventing infections of the bladder .
When it ’ s healthy , it ’ s acidic , it prevents the gut bacteria , the E. coli from the rectum from going up into the bladder .
And so it ’ s like the vaginal estrogen keeps the vagina healthy .
But women don ’ t get taught that important function of the vagina .
And that our vagina plays a role in our overall health just in general .
So I would end to answer the question of do hormones help sex lives ?
There ’ s plenty of people who aren ’ t on hormones and they have great sex lives .
She ’ s going to just be interested in having sex more .
Because it means some people who really can ’ t be on hormones , it doesn ’ t mean their sex life is doomed .
But if you ’ ve got those symptoms and a sex life that is just not thriving like you want it to , try some hormone supplements , see if it makes a difference .
It can ’ t fix all of that , which we know is important to healthy sex lives .
And the studies come back and say , two top reasons that menopausal women stop having sex , number one , untreated menopause symptoms , whether it ’ s the systemic , hot flushes , night sweats , anxiety , heart palpitations .
So whether you have a partner , you can have a fantastic sex life .
And I think it ’ s because so many women think sex is with a partner .
They don ’ t even think that sex is with themselves .
They don ’ t even think sexuality is an inside job .
And so they don ’ t even take advantage of the 24 hour a day clitoris that they ’ re walking around with .
They get to be sexual beings their entire life .
And they get to experience sex and pleasure and this is what it ’ s all about , sexual intimacy .
And so thank you , Dr. Kelly Casperson , thank you so much for being here and just answering all my questions and informing my Diamonds about this very important topic around sex , sexuality and menopause .
Let ’ s start the new year with the new empowered sexual you .
What do you want your sexual intimacy to look like in 10 or 20 years ?
If you ’ re settling now your sexual intimacy is likely to be non-existent in the future .
You have no incentive to keep engaging in sexual intimacy if it ’ s not good , if it ’ s not empowering , if it ’ s not pleasurable .
You owe it to yourself to invest in your sexual intimacy now and forever .
Couples who had not had sex in years found a new level of sexual fun and intimacy .
OYSN is not just about sex , it ’ s about empowerment for women and of course , pleasure .
I know that ’ s not the sexy answer , but it ’ s the truth. ” IF YOU STILL WANT TO DABBLE IN CRYPTO , START SMALL Once you have a grasp on how it all works , you can begin to think about allocating some of your excess cash ( after you pay your bills and meet your monthly savings goals ) toward crypto .
The claim is for equality and the freedom to defy God ’ s natural law for sexuality and marriage .
The so called right for marriage equality is an attempt by Satan to deface God ’ s natural law of sexuality and marriage established at creation .
In that choice and within the boundaries of the choice we make , we either choose to be set free from sin and live as God ’ s servants or be slaves to Satan and to live in bondage to him .

Conclusions : Regardless of sex , having either siblings or a higher birth order was positively associated with childhood thinness .

7/17/09 – NWA : Women say they married Alamo at young ages Women say they married Alama Four more women testified Thursday that they were married to evangelist Tony Alamo at young ages , including one who said she was 14 when Alamo exchanged vows with her while he was incarcerated in federal prison and another who said she was 9 when Alamo began having sex with her regularly .
“ He had told me that , to him , I look like a German whore , ” the woman , now 18 , testified .
' ” The testimony came on the fourth day of Alamo ’ s trial on charges that he transported five underage girls , all who say they were his wives at the time , across state lines for sex from March 1994 through October 2005 .
Alamo ’ s attorneys argue that the trips were for church business , not for sex .
The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette generally does not name alleged victims of sexual abuse .
In a prison visiting room , Alamo ’ s wives would crowd around him , blocking the view of guards and security cameras , while Alamo fondled her breasts and genitals , the woman said .

When she was 9 , Alamo began having sex with her as often as once a week , she said .

Best positions for pregnancy When sex isn ’ t safe We ’ re all familiar with the stereotypical symptoms a woman can experience during pregnancy—larger breasts , wider hips , stretch marks , morning sickness .
There are , however , some typical patterns in the ways that pregnancy can affect sexuality : Libido .

That contact can be genital intercourse , anal intercourse or oral intercourse .
Yes , that means that you can get syphilis from oral sex .
The treponeme needs a small cut or abrasion in the skin to cause infection which may be one of the reasons it is common among MSM ( men having sex with men ) , since anal intercourse is more traumatic than vaginal sex .
This means it is important to let your doctor know that you are having sex , so that he or she can test you for syphilis even if you don ’ t have any symptoms .
This chancre ( pronounced : SHANG-ker ) appears 3 weeks to 90 days ( up to 12 weeks ) after infection either on the penis , scrotum , mouth , back of the throat or anus .
The primary chancre is usually a single ulcer that is hard to miss when found on the penis but difficult when on the vulva , vagina or cervix , or in either gender when near the anus .
A chancre can be found on the lips , nipples , tongue or other sites .
One unlucky site is the base of the penis ( called a “ condom chancre ” ) when a sore on the vulva has come into contact with the lower part of the penis NOT covered by the condom .
Other symptoms are condylomata lata ( fancy term for wart growths ) , lymph node enlargement , spotty baldness/hair loss , mild fever , fatigue , ulcers in the mouth and anus , and weight loss .
Remember , sores sometimes appear on the lips , mouth , throat , vagina , and anus — but many people with secondary syphilis don ’ t have sores at all .
If you think you may have syphilis or if you have had sexual contact with someone who might have syphilis , see your doctor or gynecologist right away .
So it ’ s important to get checked on a regular basis , especially if you have had unprotected sex and/or more than one sex partner .
Anyone with whom you ’ ve had unprotected sex also should be checked for syphilis immediately .
The best way to prevent any STD is to not have sex .
However , for people who decide to have sex , it ’ s important to use protection .
Latex condoms are effective against most STDs ; however , if there are any sores or rashes , avoid sex until the person has seen a doctor for treatment .
You CAN get syphilis from oral sex .

Attorney 's office via AP , File ) NEW YORK ( AP ) — An ex-convict who obtained millions of dollars by subjecting his daughter ’ s ex-college roommates to forced labor and prostitution was sentenced Friday to 60 years in prison by a judge who labeled him an “ evil genius ” who used sadism and psychological torture to control every aspect of his victims ’ lives .

11 things you did n't know your vagina could do Cleaning , talking and saving lives - it practically has super powers !
'During sexual arousal or pregnancy , blood flow to the genitals changes and that can result in a colour change , ' usually making it a deeper , darker colour , says gynaecologist Michael Krychman .
Then there 's menopause to consider : Dr Krychman says the loss of oestrogen during this stage of a woman 's life can also cause the vagina to change colour , usually a lighter or more dull shade than before .
​ When you 're aroused , there 's a lot of blood flowing down to the nether regions , and blood vessels in the vagina become dilated .
'This causes the vagina and genitopelvic area to become enlarged , which is known as vaginal tenting , ' says Dr Krychman .
'It 's like going to the gym for your vagina , ' explains Dr Rickey .
​ Whether you 're in baby-making mode or about to get your period , or if there 's a serious health risk like cancer potentially going on , your vagina has a lot of important things it 's ready to tell you .
​In case you were wondering , 'the vagina is n't endless , ' says Dr. Rickey .
'The vagina connects to the uterus , but the cervix acts like a barrier between the two .
​It can trap a penis .
​ Sounds silly but it 's known as penis captivus ( a fitting name do n't you think ? )
where the vagina literally holds a penis captive when it occurs .
What happens is that during intercourse , 'the pelvic muscles of the vagina clamp down on the penis much more firmly than usual , which can make it difficult or impossible to remove the penis from the vagina ' .
It can have four different kinds of orgasm .
Clitoral : When you orgasm simply through the stimulation of the clitoris , without vaginal penetration .
Vaginal : An orgasm that 's a result of vaginal penetration , primarily , with little or no clitoral stimulation .
Multiple : What we consider the holy grail , or when a woman slightly relaxes after one orgasm - but not completely - and is then aroused again , resulting in 'multiple experiences of orgasmic pleasure in rapid succession ' .
​It 's rare , but it 's possible to be born with uterus didelphys - a condition that essentially causes the vagina to split into two separate cavities .
If an external ultrasound can ’ t show the pregnancy , the doctor might do the test with a wand-like device in the vagina .
Smoking and having multiple sexual partners also increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy .

Sex assaults reported in Jamestown JAMESTOWN , N.D. - Jamestown police are investigating three reports of suspicious activity in which women were drinking at local bars , passed out and at least two of them had sex without their knowledge .
The incidents occurred at a minimum of two locations within the past several months , Donegan said , and date rape drugs may have been involved .
Symptoms of date rape drugs - the most common are GHB , rohypnol and ketamine - include nausea , drowsiness , unconsciousness , memory loss , a dreamlike feeling , and sight and breathing problems , Donegan said .
Some sexual assault victims do n't realize they 've been assaulted until the next morning or later .
`` Short-term memory loss is associated with almost all of them ( the date rape drugs ) , '' she said .
If date rape drugs were n't involved , alcohol can still cause blackouts and memory loss , Donegan said .
Statistically , about 10 occur for each sexual assault that is reported , she said .
Donegan said to contact police if you or someone you know has been drugged and unknowingly had sexual contact .
Date rape drugs can stay in the body for 12 to 72 hours .

Since support for a proposal can vary depending on question wording , the survey posed three variations of the question , with one-third of the sample answering each question : the first version asked about support or opposition to a federal law prohibiting job discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation the second version introduced a potential consequence to not having such a law the third described the law in more detail .
In all three categories , roughly 60 % supported federal legislation to ban employment discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation .
Interestingly , the question that generated the strongest opposition to such legislation included the words “ gays and lesbians ” in place of “ sexual orientation. ” Even so , 58 % to 29 % , depending on the question , support anti-discrimination legislation .

School sexual abuse refers to when someone at a school , typically a person in a position of authority , but sometimes a peer , sexually abuses a student .

School sexual abuse can happen to girls or boys , and it can be anything from lewd behavior to touching or groping or as severe as rape .
While indicators of school sexual abuse may be different depending on the age of the victim and other factors , some typical warning signs may include : Not wanting to go to school or attend certain classes anymore A decline in grades or other academic performance Aggressive or self-destructive behavior Developing disciplinary issues Signs of fear or withdrawal from friends and family Changes in appetite or eating habits Trouble sleeping and/or nightmares Drug or alcohol use or abuse Creating sexually explicit artwork or increased talk about sexual topics It may take professional medical or psychological help to confront the issue if parents recognize the above symptoms and the child doesn ’ t engage in talking about it .

HomeArtThe Most Shocking & Controversial Art Ever Made From graphic nudity and feminist protest to childish pranks , we examine the most controversial art ever made , and the powerful impact they have had on art .
Nude bodies had appeared in art before Michelangelo , but what most shocked visitors was the expansive display of nudity across the board , from ordinary people to saints and martyrs .
But by then , Michelangelo ’ s revolutionary display of human flesh had already profoundly impacted art history , from Mannerist and Baroque decadence to the unfiltered nudity of contemporary times .
First displayed at the Paris Salon in 1865 , Manet ’ s painting depicts a nude model reclining across a sofa while a servant presents her with flowers .
That Manet had used a real model , Victorine Meurent , rather than a mythological muse was also shocking enough , but he made a series of suggestions that she was a prostitute – the name “ Olympia ” was one commonly associated with sex workers in 1860s Paris , while her surroundings echoed the style of a Parisian boudoir .
The arched black cat at the base of Olympia ’ s bed was also a well-known symbol for sexual promiscuity .
Carolee Schneemann , Meat Joy , 1964 Carolee Schneemann , Meat Joy , 1964 , performance documentation American performance artist Carolee Schneemann ’ s Meat Joy , 1964 , challenged misogynistic stereotypes with full frontal nudity and writhing displays of erotic flesh .
Reactions were extreme ; one audience member was so enraged that he even tried to strangle Schneemann , while another declared , “ I don ’ t know what it is , but it isn ’ t art. ” But Schneemann ’ s sexually liberated art revealed to audiences a new kind of unconstrained womanhood , leading the way for a wave of feminist artists throughout the 1970s .

John Rudoff/Sipa USA via AP Images Josh Hawley urges young men to 'log off the porn and go ask a real woman on a date' The Missouri senator and other Republican lawmakers have been on a crusade against pornography .
It involves reproducing and giving up porn .
Why do n't you turn off the computer and log off the porn and go ask a real woman on a date ? ''
And for young men , aspire to be something more than a consumer of pornography .
This is not the first time Hawley has railed against pornography .
He blamed liberals for undermining masculinity and driving men to porn at the National Conservatism Conference in October 2021 .
According to the Springfield News-Leader , Hawley told the conference , `` Can we be surprised that after years of being told they are the problem , that their manhood is the problem , more and more men are withdrawing into the enclave of idleness and pornography and video games ? ''
`` We 've got to say that spending your time not working — and we have more and more men who are not working — spending your time on video games , spending your time watching porn online while doing nothing , is not good for you , your family or this country . ''
Vance argued during his campaign that the nation needs a complete porn ban .
`` I think the combination of porn , abortion have basically created a really lonely , isolated generation that is n't getting married , they 're not having families , and they 're actually not even totally sure how to interact with each other , '' he told the Catholic publication Crisis Magazine in August 2021 .
Utah Sen. Mike Lee filed a bill on Dec. 14 that would redefine illegal `` obscenity '' in a way that critics say could lead to a total ban on online porn .
Republicans ' war on pornography has faltered in recent years , with the rise of the internet and court precedents making the industry virtually impossible to regulate .
In its 1973 Miller v. California ruling , the Supreme Court held that published material is generally protected as free speech unless “ ‘ the average person , applying contemporary community standards ’ would find that the work , taken as a whole , appeals to the prurient interest. ” With the internet making adult content ubiquitous , legal experts say , it is now nearly impossible to make the case that adult pornography is outside of community standards in the United States .
Few Americans see access to pornography as the most important issue facing the country right now .
Since 1973 , the University of Chicago 's General Social Survey has asked whether Americans believe pornography should be legal .
In its most recent poll in 2021 , roughly 69 % of respondents said it should be illegal to distribute porn to minors , while 26 % of respondents said it should be illegal to distribute porn to people `` whatever the age , '' and 5 % of respondents said `` there should be no laws forbidding the distribution of pornography . ''
In 2014 , UCLA professor of communications and psychology Neil Malamuth told ThinkProgress that most studies on the topic had debunked the idea that viewing pornography was damaging to men .
`` For the majority of men , we do n't really find any negative effects [ from viewing pornography ] and even find what they consider positive effects , '' he said , with the caveat that watching porn can have negative effects `` for a small , but important minority [ of ] men . ''
The human rights principles called for protection from discrimination on the basis of age , sex , sexual orientation , family or marital status , race , colour , ethnic origin , ancestry , disability , creed and socioeconomic status .
A House of Bishops ’ statement says sexual orientation in and of itself is not a barrier to ordination but exemplary behaviour for persons who are not married includes a commitment to remain chaste .
He said that while sexual orientation may not be a barrier to ordination , attitude might be for those who “ do not want to come under the grace of God. ” Rising to oppose the set of human rights principles , Bishop Caleb Lawrence of Moosenee said it was his most “ painful moment of the synod. ” He said the principles could be interpreted as condoning an “ action , a way of life , ” a lifestyle .
“ I would be legislated to something I can not accept in conscience. ” In related business , the synod approved an amended motion commending the House of Bishops for its 1997 affirmation of its 1979 human sexuality statement and acknowledging the need for continued study and dialogue .
In a news release , the Essentials group said the bishops ’ action in defeating the human rights ’ principles and the reaffirmation of their guidelines on homosexuality is a clear signal the church still affirms that the place for sexual relations is “ within holy matrimony between a man and a woman. ” Essentials representatives at General Synod were “ greatly encouraged that traditional Anglican teaching on sexuality was so strongly affirmed by the highest governing body in the church , ” the release said .

It 's easier for an authority figure like a priest to sexually victimize children , says psychologist Cliff Seruntine , who has worked with sex offenders and has a private practice in Antigonish .
Predators `` groom ' victims Mr. Seruntine said predators `` groom '' their victims , and since children are taught to believe that adults are `` smart '' and `` have their best interests '' in mind , it 's easy to see why sexual abuse victims remain silent .
Mr. Seruntine , who had a childhood friend who was sexually abused by a priest in Louisiana , said sexual abuse victims generally have enormous amounts of anger , even years after the abuse has passed .
The majority of sexual predators rarely reform themselves , he said .
Some assert that God is sexless as He transcends sex or gender .

A Woman 's Testosterone Level Perhaps you feel that you no longer have any interest in sex or sexual pleasure as you used to in the past ?
Maybe your brain is cooperating , but you feel that you body has jumped ship because your clitoris is just not as sensitive as it used to be or it may even be painful to stimulate ?
Many women have experienced a decrease in sexual pleasure and desire because of the effects of lowered testosterone , and my question here today is do women need testosterone ?
There is no exact level of testosterone that correlates with good sexual functioning and appropriate levels of sexual desire .
Since testosterone maintains erectile tissue and part of a person 's desire for sex , it helps support the clitoris and it 's adjoining erectile tissue as well as a woman 's libido .
Women may find that they have lost sensation in their clitoris compared to what it used to be .
Also , they may find that it becomes difficult to lubricate when they are sexually aroused , even after considerable amount of stimulation or even orgasm .
The glands which produce this lubrication that surround the opening of the vagina can also become easily irritated as the tissues there become frail due to the lack of support from testosterone .
If a woman is experiencing any of these symptoms as well as a significant change in her level of sexual desire , she may benefit from having some testosterone replacement .
The effects can be so dramatic for some women that they may develop vulvodynia , which is pain at the entrance of the vagina and surrounding tissues .

Professor Barondes noted that the court applies an analysis that relies on the notion that the government may deny civil rights or protections to those not “ virtuous. ” He highlighted that this approach , often disfavored in current jurisprudence outside consideration of firearms rights , has historically been odiously referenced , for example , to justify diminished governmental protection against sexual predation directed at women deemed not “ virtuous . ”

Sexual Harassment : UNILAG unveils special task force The University of Lagos has set up a task force to address issues of sexual harassment with a view to stemming it .
The university ’ s Principal Assistant Registrar for Communication , Mrs Taiwo Oloyede , said in a statement that it was “ in continuation of the institution ’ s unrelenting campaign against the menace of sexual harassment and other forms of inappropriate behaviours. ” The institution recently suspended two senior lecturers exposed in alleged sexual harassment in a BBC investigative documentary video .
“ The task force has the mandate to examine the extant University of Lagos policy on sexual harassment , receive complaints from faculties , departments and other units concerning matters that border on sexual harassment .
“ It is to also receive oral and written testimonies from staff and students involved in cases of sexual harassment and recommend appropriate sanction for offenders .
“ The task force , in addition to other functions , will put forward counselling and other therapies for mitigating the adverse effects of sexual harassment on victims and carry out other duties aimed at eradicating the ugly trend from the institution , ’ ’ the statement read in part .

First of all , both CMV and Zika virus can be transmitted sexually , though they are not the first things you think of when the topic of STDs comes up , as they are overshadowed by more famous sexually transmitted viruses like herpes and human papillomavirus .
While many of us are infected with CMV as children , we can also be infected as adults , often through sexual transmission — the virus can be found in cervical and vaginal secretions , saliva , and semen .
The sexual transmission of Zika virus is not as well understood , but we know it can be found in semen , and there are documented cases of men passing the virus to sex partners through vaginal and anal intercourse .
It might even be transmitted from a male to a partner by oral sex .
The virus can infect a fetus via two main routes of transmission : ( 1 ) direct transmission , in which CMV is attached to semen and infects the embryo directly , and ( 2 ) transplacentally , in which the virus crosses the placenta to infect the fetus in the uterus .
If you are pregnant , you can reduce your risk of CMV infection by : avoiding other people ’ s saliva : don ’ t share food , drinks or straws , or eating utensils with other people don ’ t put a pacifier in your mouth , as CMV infections are common in children don ’ t share toothbrushes , and keep your toothbrush in an area that toddlers can ’ t access try kissing children less than 6 years of age on the forehead or the top of the head to avoid saliva wash your hands , especially after feeding young children , wiping their noses or drool , handling their toys , or changing diapers practicing safe sex : if your sexual partner has CMV , use a latex condom during sex You can learn more about CMV and congenital CMV infections at the websites of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , American Academy of Family Physicians , Mayo Clinic , and the National CMV Foundation .

The Swedish prosecutor , Marianne Ny , has refused to come to London to question Assange about allegations of sexual misconduct in Stockholm in 2010 – even though Swedish law allows for it and the procedure is routine for Sweden and the UK .
On 20 August 2010 , the Swedish police opened a “ rape investigation ” and immediately — and unlawfully — told the Stockholm tabloids that there was a warrant for Assange ’ s arrest for the “ rape of two women ” .
Twitter accounts associated with the Pentagon described Assange as a “ rapist ” and a “ fugitive ” .
Katrin Axelsson and Lisa Longstaff of Women Against Rape wrote : “ The allegations against [ Assange ] are a smokescreen behind which a number of governments are trying to clamp down on WikiLeaks for having audaciously revealed to the public their secret planning of wars and occupations with their attendant rape , murder and destruction… The authorities care so little about violence against women that they manipulate rape allegations at will .

ARTICLES MOVIES & TV 4 WAYS THE '50 SHADES OF GREY ' FILM IS WORSE THAN YOU EXPECT 4 Ways the '50 Shades of Grey ' Film Is Worse Than You Expect Kier Harris The trailer for Twilight fan fiction turned inexplicable best-selling trilogy Fifty Shades of Grey debuted recently , treating us all to a glimpse of a world populated by frumpy secretaries and the Picasso-faced businessmen who have sex with them .
But because the novel , at its core , is terrible , and because Hollywood has no idea how to handle any exploration of sex that does n't conform to a very specific road map of male domination and plot cliches , this movie is n't even going to provide the trashy fun that made the book a success in the first place .
We 're not sure if that line is worse if uttered during a literal dance or a sexual one .
3 The Male Lead Is So Boring , Nobody Wanted to Play Him Christian Grey , the lead male character , is best described as an impossibly rich white man with a helicopter who `` knows what he wants and gets it , '' which in this case is punishing sex with subservient women .
So basically , he 's a dick on a magic broom .
His penis is the only unique personality trait he has , which probably explains why no one wants to play him .
Then , after Charlie Hunnam backed out , citing some bullshit excuse about his Sons of Anarchy television schedule ( which the studio must have been aware of when they initially hired him ) , they finally settled for the guy who played the sheriff on one season of Once Upon a Time , because signing up for a prospective trilogy about a magically rich piece of Wonder bread with the physique of a Greek statue is a smart move for an actor whose primary talent is his ability to appear shirtless on screen .
2 It 's Confusing an Abusive Relationship With Bondage Christian Grey is a `` cold-hearted predator with a dungeon filled with toys , '' and it 's heavily implied that his predilection for bondage sex is a result of a mental disorder .
Most real people who enjoy S & M are mentally healthy , and they tend to ease newcomers into things , rather than traumatize them with blowtorches and electric nipple clamps .
Grey messes up the most basic of bondage rules : Cable ties are a bad idea .

Basically , any and all sense of sexual liberation this book outlined for people will be replaced by the standard `` naked butts thrusting together in amber lighting '' the film industry is used to , only this time there will be handcuffs and blindfolds .
Despite the fact that the only reason people cared about this series in the first place was because of the graphic sexual content , the producers of Fifty Shades of Grey are insisting that what really got everyone 's attention was the boring , hackneyed love story that served as the excuse for all the trussed-up boner jams .

I didn ’ t really see anything other than his pale ass , but I was freaking out anyway .
He was rifling through my bag and he had a pair of my panties in his hand .
I shouted , “ What are you doing in my bag , Kevin ? ” He jumped at the sound of my voice and dropped my panties on the ground .
Shortly after the tinkling sounds stopped , a rather small , limp penis began to slowly protrude through the hole .
I can talk you through it. ” Something about my lack of experience clearly turned the man on , because his soft , little cock was very quickly poking straight out .
His cock was maybe five inches long and once it cleared the divider there wasn ’ t really anything that extended past my hand .
I started to suck on it softly and started to tickle the underside with my tongue .
It was by far the boldest thing that I had ever done in my life , sexual or otherwise .
What did you have in mind ? ” I may have been sexually naive , but by that point , I had realized that this was not a peephole .
Within seconds he was easing his cock through the hole .
I loved the way that this guy ’ s cock felt in my mouth .
I struggled through for as long as possible as his cock throbbed and jerked in my mouth .
Don ’ t let anybody tell you otherwise. ” “ I ’ ll bet that you say that to all of the girls that suck your dick. ” I countered .
As I sat there I realized that my panties were soaking wet .
A paranoid , motherly voice inside my head wondered if it wasn ’ t a ramification of my recent sexual experience .
I pulled my shorts outward and could clearly see that my panties were soaked through .
As I slowly peeled them down , they clung tightly to my pussy .
Thin strands of my excitement appeared as pulled my panties away .
I also realized how long I had repressed my sexual urges .
His cock was long enough that I could easily keep my entire hand on it while I explored as much as I could with my mouth .
But I also thought to myself that this didn ’ t seem like a beginner ’ s cock .
Can ’ t blame a guy for asking , can you ? ” I continued to bob on his cock as one hand remained between my legs .
I had heard a friend talk about her clitoris and how good it felt when her boyfriend touched it with his tongue .
Within a couple of minutes , the man grunted , “ I ’ m going to cum ! ” I was determined to finish this stud off properly .
I removed my hand from between my thighs and returned it to my new friend ’ s ample cock .
There was a loud ‘ ahhhh ’ as his cock bobbed aggressively in my mouth .
A flood of semen splashed and filled my mouth .
I peeled the foreskin back a bit and continued softly licking up any remaining cum .
His cock still hanging limply before me .
I started to head out of the bathroom when I realized that my very wet panties might be a bit of an issue .
I knew that women could masturbate and I had just discovered my clitoris , or so I thought .
I always liked you , but now you have become such a sexy , young woman .
His rock-hard cock sprung up from its restraints .
His lower body quickly followed as I felt his hard cock poking against my midsection .
I don ’ t know if he was really good at it , or if it was just because I was really horny , but everything that he did felt right .
I reached down for his cock .
He slowly pulled my shorts down revealing that I had removed my panties earlier .
I knew that he was trying to hold back and make the moment sexy , but he lost control for a second and buried his face between my legs .
I asked him , “ Do you have a condom ? ” He still had his shorts technically on , although they were still slid down and his cock was peeking out .
He looked at me and said , “ Tonight you are going to have your first orgasm. ” He lowered himself down and quickly found my clitoris with his tongue .
Kevin locked his arms around my upper thighs , lifting my butt slightly off of the ground .
With each new sensation , I kept thinking to myself ‘ Is this an orgasm ? ’ My body kept trying to bridge up or squirm free , but he would not release me .
I started to shout “ Oh , fuck !
Oh , fuck !
Oh , fuck ! ” into my wadded-up shirt .
I can ’ t believe that I said ‘ fuck ’ .
He slid his shorts and underwear off in one motion , revealing his still hard cock .
His cock hovered just above my abdomen .
With his left hand on my thigh and his right hand on his cock he guided himself at me and gave a push .
I could feel the heat radiating off of his cock through the condom .
I think that his cock was most of the way in at that point .
He held me down tightly onto his cock .
Oh , fuck , god !
I ’ m cumming ! ” I could feel his cock throbbing inside of me .
As strange as it may sound , I was also relieved that I was able to satisfy a man sexually .
I could feel his cock softening inside me .
He backed away from me and his cock squirted free .
Not only do I feel for them and their tragedy but I also ship them , hardcore .

The appeal considered whether the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 , ss 58 and 59 , and the Criminal Justice Act ( NI ) 1945 , s 25 are incompatible with ECHR , arts 3 , 8 and 14 in failing to provide an exception to the prohibition of the termination of pregnancy in Northern Ireland in cases of serious malformation of the unborn child/foetus or pregnancy as a result of rape or incest .
On the substantive compatibility issues , a majority – Lord Mance , Lord Kerr , Lord Wilson and Lady Hale – held that the current law is incompatible with the right to respect for private and family life , guaranteed by art 8 of the Convention , insofar as it prohibits abortion in cases of rape , incest and fatal foetal abnormality .
The words of Lord Mance call upon the Northern Irish legislature , in as strong terms as it is possible without a formal declaration of incompatibility , to urgently consider amending the law : “ I am in short satisfied that the present legislative position in Northern Ireland is untenable and intrinsically disproportionate in excluding from any possibility of abortion pregnancies involving fatal foetal abnormality or due to rape or incest .

CANCERS OF THE ANUS Lower gastrointestinal cancers include malignant tumors of the colon , rectum , and anus .
This provocative hypothesis is supported by several reports of increased amounts of fecal anaerobes in the stools of patients with colorectal cancer .
Proctosigmoidoscopy is a sufficient screening procedure because polyps tend to be evenly distributed from cecum to anus , making more invasive and expensive techniques such as colonoscopy or barium enema unnecessary .
OTHER HIGH-RISK CONDITIONS For unknown reasons , individuals who develop endocarditis or septicemia from this fecal bacterium have a high incidence of occult colorectal tumors and , possibly , upper gastrointestinal cancers as well .
For unexplained reasons , however , the proportion of large-bowel cancers arising in the rectum has been decreasing during the past several decades , with a corresponding increase in the proportion of cancers in the more proximal descending colon .
TABLE 40-3Screening Strategies for Colorectal Cancer TABLE 40-3 Screening Strategies for Colorectal Cancer • Fecal DNA • Contrast barium enema • Virtual ( i.e. , computed tomography colonography ) • Flexible sigmoidoscopy Many programs directed at the early detection of colorectal cancers have focused on digital rectal examinations and fecal occult blood ( i.e. , stool guaiac ) testing .
The digital examination should be part of any routine physical evaluation in adults older than age 40 years , serving as a screening test for prostate cancer in men , a component of the pelvic examination in women , and an inexpensive maneuver for the detection of masses in the rectum .
The development of the fecal occult blood test has greatly facilitated the detection of occult fecal blood .
Unfortunately , even when performed optimally , the fecal occult blood test has major limitations as a screening technique .
About 50 % of patients with documented colorectal cancers have a negative fecal occult blood test , consistent with the intermittent bleeding pattern of these tumors .
When random cohorts of asymptomatic persons have been tested , 2–4 % have fecal occult blood-positive stools .
Nonetheless , persons found to have fecal occult blood-positive stool routinely undergo further medical evaluation , including sigmoidoscopy and/or colonoscopy—procedures that are not only uncomfortable and expensive but also associated with a small risk for significant complications .
The added cost of these studies would appear justifiable if the small number of patients found to have occult neoplasms because of fecal occult blood screening could be shown to have an improved prognosis and prolonged survival .
With the appreciation that the carcinogenic process leading to the progression of the normal bowel mucosa to an adenomatous polyp and then to a cancer is the result of a series of molecular changes , investigators have examined fecal DNA for evidence of mutations associated with such molecular changes as evidence of the occult presence of precancerous lesions or actual malignancies .
Such a strategy has been tested in more than 4000 asymptomatic individuals whose stool was assessed for occult blood and for 21 possible mutations in fecal DNA ; these study subjects also underwent colonoscopy .
Although the fecal DNA strategy suggested the presence of more advanced adenomas and cancers than did the fecal occult blood testing approach , the overall sensitivity , using colonoscopic findings as the standard , was less than 50 % , diminishing enthusiasm for further pursuit of the fecal DNA screening strategy .
With the appreciation of the inadequacy of fecal occult blood testing alone , concerns about the practicality of imaging approaches , and the wider adoption of endoscopic examinations by the primary care community , screening strategies in asymptomatic persons have changed .
At present , both the American Cancer Society and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network suggest either fecal occult blood testing annually coupled with flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years or colonoscopy every 10 years beginning at age 50 in asymptomatic individuals with no personal or family history of polyps or colorectal cancer .
At present , colonoscopy performed every 10 years has been offered as an alternative to annual fecal occult blood testing with periodic ( every 5 years ) flexible sigmoidoscopy .
Colonoscopy has been shown to be superior to double-contract barium enema and also to have a higher sensitivity for detecting villous or dysplastic adenomas or cancers than the strategy using occult fecal blood testing and flexible sigmoidoscopy .
Because the cancers may bleed intermittently , a random fecal occult blood test may be negative .
A major exception to this rule occurs in patients having primary tumors in the distal rectum , from which tumor cells may spread through the paravertebral venous plexus , escaping the portal venous system and thereby reaching the lungs or supraclavicular lymph nodes without hepatic involvement .
This alarmingly high rate of local disease recurrence is believed to be due to the fact that the contained anatomic space within the pelvis limits the extent of the resection and because the rich lymphatic network of the pelvic side wall immediately adjacent to the rectum facilitates the early spread of malignant cells into surgically inaccessible tissue .
Cancers of the anus account for 1–2 % of the malignant tumors of the large bowel .
Most such lesions arise in the anal canal , the anatomic area extending from the anorectal ring to a zone approximately halfway between the pectinate ( or dentate ) line and the anal verge .
Carcinomas arising proximal to the pectinate line ( i.e. , in the transitional zone between the glandular mucosa of the rectum and the squamous epithelium of the distal anus ) are known as basaloid , cuboidal , or cloacogenic tumors ; about one-third of anal cancers have this histologic pattern .
Malignancies arising distal to the pectinate line have squamous histology , ulcerate more frequently , and constitute ~55 % of anal cancers .
The prognosis for patients with basaloid and squamous cell cancers of the anus is identical when corrected for tumor size and the presence or absence of nodal spread .
The development of anal cancer is associated with infection by human papillomavirus , the same organism etiologically linked to cervical cancer .
The virus is sexually transmitted .
The infection may lead to anal warts ( condyloma acuminata ) , which may progress to anal intraepithelial neoplasia and on to squamous cell carcinoma .
The risk for anal cancer is increased among homosexual males , presumably related to anal intercourse .
Vaccination against human papilloma viruses may reduce the eventual risk for anal cancer .
Tumor recurrences develop in < 10 % of these patients , meaning that ~70 % of patients with anal cancers can be cured with nonoperative treatment and without the need for a colostomy .

Last month , charges were filed against a pair of East New York pimps who were allegedly involved in the sex trafficking of nearly a dozen underage girls from out of state .
According to the Brooklyn district attorney ’ s office , Jonathan “ Jayo ” Harris , 25 and Tariq “ Ricky ” Washington , 23 , both of East New York have been indicted on nearly 40-counts of sex trafficking , promoting prostitution , rape , assault and endangering the welfare of a child .
According to the investigation , Harris and Washington rented motel rooms around Brooklyn to which they would drive the young women to participate in sex work with men .
They each face up to 25 years in prison and will have to register as sex offenders if convicted .
July 12 , four women in Crown Heights were sexually assaulted within four hours by a suspect who police believed to be the same person .

Work by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) on the Eleventh Revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ( ICD-11 ) and by the American Psychiatric Association on the Fifth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ) has led to vigorous debates in the scientific literature , among clinicians and health advocates , and in the lay media ( for example , regarding the inclusion of gaming disorder and compulsive sexual behaviour disorder ) [ 1 , 2 ] .
The term applies to a group of disorders of early onset that affect both cognitive and social communicative development , are multi-factorial in origin , display important sex differences where males are more commonly affected than females , and have a chronic course with impairment generally lasting into adulthood [ 4 ] .
The ICD-11 definition nevertheless provides examples of experiences , such as torture , slavery , genocide campaigns , prolonged domestic violence , and repeated childhood sexual or physical abuse , that may be associated with the diagnosis .
Fifth , by creating residual categories ( ‘ other specified ’ or ‘ unspecified disorders of addictive behaviour ’ ) attention is given to individuals not meeting the diagnostic criteria for an existing disorder , who nevertheless experience significant distress or impairment associated with a range of otherwise neglected addictive behaviors that might include shopping , stealing , pornography viewing , web-streaming , social media use , and other behaviors , for which there is as yet insufficient evidence to justify classification as a diagnosis .
Indeed , discussion in the scientific literature has continued as emerging data suggests that , alongside the phenomenological and psychobiological overlaps between gambling and gaming disorders and disorders of substance addiction [ 98 , 99 ] , including high levels of clinical comorbidity , overlaps are also to be found with certain impulse control disorders , such as kleptomania and compulsive sexual behaviour disorder , and obsessive–compulsive or related disorders such as trichotillomania and excoriation disorder [ 100 , 101 ] .
Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder Peer Briken ( Fig .
16 ) The decision to include compulsive sexual behaviour disorder ( CSBD ) in the group of impulse control disorders in the ICD-11 marks a paradigm shift from a sexual and mental health perspective , especially considering that CSBD is now precisely described through diagnostic guidelines [ 2 , 100 ] .
The ICD-10 included the category ‘ excessive sexual drive ’ , which , however , did not include a specific description of the symptoms but did reference ‘ nymphomania ’ and ‘ satyriasis ’ .
The diagnosis was placed in the grouping of sexual dysfunctions within the Mental and Behavioral Disorders chapter of the ICD-10 because it concerned sexual behaviour .
He is a consultant to the World Health Organization regarding the development of the ICD-11 classification of sexual disorders and sexual health In contrast , the ICD-11 guidelines describe CSBD as characterized by “ a persistent pattern of failure to control intense , repetitive sexual impulses or urges resulting in repetitive sexual behaviour ” ( [ 2 ] , p. 109 ) over an extended period .
In persons with this disorder , sexual behaviour has become a central focus of their life , with unsuccessful efforts to control or significantly reduce it as well as adverse consequences ( e.g .
traumatic sexual experiences ) and the many contexts in which compulsive sexual behaviour occur ( e.g .
using sex as a coping strategy in response to negative emotions ) .
Although the word ‘ compulsive ’ is included in the name because that is a very common way of referring to this phenomenon in the literature , sexual behaviour in CSBD is not considered a true compulsion that occurs in relation to intrusive , unwanted and typically anxiety-provoking thoughts ( obsessions ) as in OCD .
The most thoroughly investigated theoretical model on the interplay between excitatory and inhibitory influences on sexual behaviour is the dual control model [ 108 ] , according to which CS BD could be a problem when sexual self-control is relatively low and sexual responsiveness/excitability is relatively high [ 109 , 110 ] .
Clinically , the lack of self-control is often subjectively experienced as urgency , while sex in CSBD may fulfill a variety of different functions .
Treatment therefore focuses on improvement of sexual self-control as well as coping with the underlying emotional states and motives .
Available representative community data indicate that subjective difficulty in adequately controlling sexual behaviour is common [ 111 ] , although such subjective difficulty alone is not sufficient for a diagnosis of CSDB .
The ICD-11 guidelines indicate that CSBD “ should not be diagnosed based on distress related to moral judgements and disapproval about sexual impulses , urges , or behaviours that would otherwise not be considered indicative of psychopathology ( e.g .
a woman who believes that she should not have sexual impulses at all ; a religious young man who believes that he should never masturbate ; a person who is distressed about their homosexual attraction or behaviour ) . ” Available evidence suggests a prevalence of 10–12 % for men and 7 % for women for sexual compulsivity ; however , the new CSBD guidelines are yet to be used in epidemiological studies ( e.g .
From a sexual and mental health perspective , inclusion in the classification system suggests that CSBD can be treated , that mental health service systems should be capable of providing the treatment , and that this treatment should be covered by health insurance .
In German psychopathology , there has been a discussion about compulsive or dysregulated forms of sexual expression since the 1940s ( overview in Giese [ 120 ] ) .
The discussion became internationally prominent in the US following the publication , in 1983 , of Carnes ’ book Out of the Shadows : Understanding Sexual Addiction [ 121 ] , which provided a conceptualization of the sexual addiction model and how 12-step self-help programmes could be helpful .
At a minimum , it must be acknowledged that , in some parts of the world , including North America , there is a risk that any conceptualization of non-mainstream sexuality as disordered will be seized upon in unintended , sex-negative ways based on religious attitudes hostile to sexuality and by religiously based therapies or self-help groups .
In order to rule out inappropriate pathologization and protect against misuse , the guidelines state that “ distress that is entirely related to moral judgments and disapproval about sexual impulses , urges , or behaviours is not sufficient to meet this requirement ” .
The guidelines further indicate that high levels of sexual interest and behaviour in the absence of impaired sexual self-control and distress or impairment , or during relatively brief periods , should not be diagnosed as CSBD .
Similarly , high levels of sexual interest and behaviour in adolescents should not be labeled as CSBD , even if associated with distress .
[ 123 ] ) that the idea that sexual behaviour can be compulsive or resemble an addiction emerged as a product of conservative ( e.g .
religious ) sexual norms , accompanied by new psychiatric diagnostic labels .
We live in a digital world where the availability of pornography and the possibilities of sexual interactions without prolonged relationships have changed the reasons why patients come into clinical practice .
For example , 20 years ago , most cases involved visits to peep shows or use of sex workers or telephone sex , whereas , currently , CSBD is primarily related to the use of digital media , most often with uncontrolled use of pornography sites or multiple sexual contacts via dating apps .
Of note , when CSBD occurs in combination with a paraphilic disorder or criminal sexual behaviour it has a different profile .
On the other hand , it is important that the threshold emphasizes clearly pathological behaviour — not all individuals who claim they are ‘ sex addicts ’ automatically fulfill the diagnostic requirements for CSBD .
These names highlight the core of the condition , that is , incongruence between a person ’ s experienced gender or gender identity and the sex ( usually ) assigned at birth .
People may seek psychological care or gender-confirming treatment to alter physical sex characteristics ( e.g .

SILDENAFIL CITRATE TABLETS ( sildenafil citrate ) tablets , for oral use Warnings and Precautions , Effects on the Eye ( 5.3 ) SILDENAFIL CITRATE TABLETS are a phosphodiesterase-5 ( PDE5 ) inhibitor indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction ( ED ) ( 1 ) For most patients , the recommended dose is 50 mg taken , as needed , approximately 1 hour before sexual activity .
However , SILDENAFIL CITRATE TABLETS may be taken anywhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours before sexual activity ( 2.1 ) Administration of SILDENAFIL CITRATE TABLETS to patients using nitric oxide donors , such as organic nitrates or organic nitrites in any form .
SILDENAFIL CITRATE TABLETS were shown to potentiate the hypotensive effect of nitrates ( 4.1 , 7.1 , 12.2 ) Patients should not use SILDENAFIL CITRATE TABLETS if sexual activity is inadvisable due to cardiovascular status ( 5.1 ) Patients should seek emergency treatment if an erection lasts > 4 hours .
For most patients , the recommended dose is 50 mg taken , as needed , approximately 1 hour before sexual activity .
However , SILDENAFIL CITRATE TABLETS may be taken anywhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours before sexual activity .
There is a potential for cardiac risk of sexual activity in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease .
Therefore , treatments for erectile dysfunction , including SILDENAFIL CITRATE TABLETS , should not be generally used in men for whom sexual activity is inadvisable because of their underlying cardiovascular status .
While this normally would be expected to be of little consequence in most patients , prior to prescribing SILDENAFIL CITRATE TABLETS , physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying cardiovascular disease could be affected adversely by such vasodilatory effects , especially in combination with sexual activity .
SILDENAFIL CITRATE TABLETS should be used with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis ( such as angulation , cavernosal fibrosis or Peyronie 's disease ) , or in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism ( such as sickle cell anemia , multiple myeloma , or leukemia ) .
The use of SILDENAFIL CITRATE TABLETS offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases .
Counseling of patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases , including the Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) , may be considered .
Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity , and a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of sildenafil citrate without sexual activity .
Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after the use of sildenafil citrate and sexual activity .
It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to sildenafil citrate , to sexual activity , to the patient 's underlying cardiovascular disease , to a combination of these factors , or to other factors [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
Effects of Sildenafil Citrate on Erectile Response : In eight double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover studies of patients with either organic or psychogenic erectile dysfunction , sexual stimulation resulted in improved erections , as assessed by an objective measurement of hardness and duration of erections ( RigiScan® ) , after sildenafil citrate administration compared with placebo .
In clinical studies , sildenafil citrate was assessed for its effect on the ability of men with erectile dysfunction ( ED ) to engage in sexual activity and in many cases specifically on the ability to achieve and maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual activity .
The studies that established benefit demonstrated improvements in success rates for sexual intercourse compared with placebo .
The primary measure in the principal studies was a sexual function questionnaire ( the International Index of Erectile Function - IIEF ) administered during a 4-week treatment-free run-in period , at baseline , at follow-up visits , and at the end of double-blind , placebo-controlled , at-home treatment .
Two of the questions from the IIEF served as primary study endpoints ; categorical responses were elicited to questions about ( 1 ) the ability to achieve erections sufficient for sexual intercourse and ( 2 ) the maintenance of erections after penetration .
The possible categorical responses to these questions were ( 0 ) no attempted intercourse , ( 1 ) never or almost never , ( 2 ) a few times , ( 3 ) sometimes , ( 4 ) most times , and ( 5 ) almost always or always .
Also collected as part of the IIEF was information about other aspects of sexual function , including information on erectile function , orgasm , desire , satisfaction with intercourse , and overall sexual satisfaction .
In these studies , involving about 1600 patients , analyses of patient diaries showed no effect of sildenafil citrate on rates of attempted intercourse ( about 2 per week ) , but there was clear treatment-related improvement in sexual function : per patient weekly success rates averaged 1.3 on 50–100 mg of sildenafil citrate vs 0.4 on placebo ; similarly , group mean success rates ( total successes divided by total attempts ) were about 66 % on sildenafil citrate vs about 20 % on placebo .
The use of SILDENAFIL CITRATE TABLETS offers no protection against sexually transmitted diseases .
Counseling of patients about the protective measures necessary to guard against sexually transmitted diseases , including the Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) , may be considered [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) ] .
SILDENAFIL CITRATE TABLETS does not protect you or your partner from getting sexually transmitted diseases , including HIV—the virus that causes AIDS .
SILDENAFIL CITRATE TABLETS helps a man with erectile dysfunction get and keep an erection only when he is sexually excited ( stimulated ) .
Take SILDENAFIL CITRATE TABLETS about 1 hour before sexual activity .
You may take SILDENAFIL CITRATE TABLETS between 30 minutes to 4 hours before sexual activity if needed .

This is because even acts that people might consider innocuous , such as calling someone numerous times in a day , often lead to more heinous criminal acts such as kidnapping , assault , and sexual assault .
Under New York Penal Code § 120.55 , the crime of stalking in the second degree involves engaging in conduct that gives the victim reason to believe and fear that you will physically harm , kidnap , commit a sex crime , or commit a sex offense against them , and in the course of posing this threat against them , you also display a weapon .
Alternative conditions for this charge under the criminal code include : Doing the above indicated acts after having previously been convicted of a predicate sex offense , or Stalking at least 10 different individuals in 10 separate instances .

Even if you are n't naturally compatible in terms of sexual likes and dislikes , by communicating comfortably about sex , the two of you will be far more likely to be able to meet in the middle and become compatible .
I hope that you 'll become excited , rather than concerned , about the prospect of exploring your sexual compatibility with this partner .
Once you gain a little experience with him , make sure you 're comfortable enough to communicate what you like and do n't like sexually , and enjoy the fact that he has some pleasure tips and tricks to share with you .

authentic , marriage problems , sexual intimacy , Uncategorized Enough already with all these silly attempts to paint men into a corner as bumbling adolescents with a one-track mind .
TV sitcoms , one-liner jokes , stand-up comedy routines and conversations at the local hair salon brim with commentary about the male sexual appetite .
Now , I ’ m not saying sex and fun shouldn ’ t mingle closely .
I just think we as wives have a passionate privilege to please our husbands sexually .
So let ’ s not get caught up in unfair stereotypes about sex and men .
Instead , let ’ s get to the high calling of sexually pleasing our husbands .
Here are 5 ways to sexually please your husband… 1 .
Be sexually confident .
Do you want your husband sexually ?
Do you occasionally take the lead in bed and let him be on the receiving end of all things sexual ?
I was simply trying to throw falsehoods to the wind that being a strong and faithful Christian wife is incongruent with being sexually confident .
If anything , being a Christian wife should go hand-in-hand with sexual confidence .
Marriage is the one place where sex is not a sin .
All other circumstances that involve sex are intricately entwined with grieving the Lord ’ s heart .
That ’ s where we can confidently embrace sexual intimacy for all it is worth .
If you are not sure how to grow in your sexual confidence , the good news is you can learn .
Enjoy your orgasm and his orgasm .
I ’ ve long held to the mantra that while orgasm may not be everything , it certainly is a very strong something .
And though I know for some women in particular , having an orgasm EVERY time is not necessary for the sexual encounter to be fulfilling , I always get a little leery if a wife says she couldn ’ t care less about climaxing .
And if you are a wife who struggles with climaxing , consider the posts I ’ ve written about orgasm on my orgasm page .
I think too many Christian wives allow themselves to be held captive by sexual inhibition that is anything but Christian .
A loving doe , a graceful deer — may her breasts satisfy you always , may you ever be captivated by her love. ” So there we have it , straight from the Lord : A “ fountain ” ( code word for penis ) , a wife , breasts , satisfaction , captivation and love .
Check your heart to see if it is aligned with God ’ s Word on what it means to freely and passionately enjoy sex with your husband .
When you pursue your husband sexually , you aren ’ t just saying yes to sex , you are saying yes to the Lord .
Be sexually playful with your clothes on .
You don ’ t want to tease unless you are going to follow through , so make sure your sexual playfulness is alluring , not aggravating .
If you struggle with being sexually playful , then you ’ re just going to have to get out of your comfort zone and try something .
Here are 5 ways to be sexually playful while clothed .

One of many things I love about my husband is he has never forced himself on me or made me feel guilty about not having sex .
What I saw and experienced as a young girl/woman and because I was a Christian and the pressure it put on females I didn ’ t want to have sex .
Not avoid sex and pretend to have a headache .
He admitted he has watched porn but not since the time I saw it on his computer .
Something he never told me before but that his grandmother introduced it too him because it was how she introduced womens body to teach him about sex .
Back then there was nothing else because people were hesitant and closed minded about sex .
He convinced me with his story but part of me still thinks he was watching porn .
He promises as a Christian man , husband and father that he has not in a long time and will not look at porn ever again .
Besides social media has plenty of porn what can you do .

lingerie , high heels , etc… Also and I don ’ t want to be vulgar but is it wrong for a husband to want to climax during oral sex ?
Key is that it is within the privacy of your lovemaking .
As far as a husband wanting to climax during oral sex , I think this is very common .
A wife may not want to swallow or receive the semen into her mouth , but some wives don ’ t mind this .
Key is good communication and respect between a husband and a wife so that they are nurturing fun and satisfying sexual encounters , but not forcing one spouse to do something they don ’ t want to do .
How about just saying yes more than a few times a year… It is very common for the husband to want to climax from or during oral sex .
For wives who are working on building sexual confidence , the important thing is having and keeping a positive and enthusiastic attitude .
Rhianna says : My hubby loves deep kissing and giving me manual stimulation while I do the same to him as foreplay….for me a good kiss is just as good….the other reason he likes kissing me is because we both get very aroused ( me very wet him erect ) and this leads to the most satisfying lovemaking ever .
I feel like throughout our relationship I ’ ve initiated sex with her , but she hardly ever initiates unless I question about her lack of initiation .

I will admit that there ’ s been times in our marriage when we didn ’ t have much sex for different reasons ( he and I both worked long hours , kids​ , etc ) and it affected every aspect of our marriage even though we didn ’ t realize it at the time .
I did realize it after a lull in our lovemaking that we both needed each other ’ s affections and that sometimes life had to wait .
It would be sinful , however , if he were to go to lust after strippers in a strip club .
Plus , it ’ s a great aerobic workout for me , it helps me feel more confident and sexual , and no , you don ’ t have to have a pole to make it work .
God wants us to experience pleasure and love in our spouses , lovemaking , and marriages .
He says he know he has a problem , but I don ’ t feel he actually excepts it , because he is always making comments about taking care of his wife meaning sexually and I have expressed to him that the sex is for him because I ’ m not getting any gratification from it .
With Gods help I have gotten my sexual urges under control and I am totally committed to my husband and have never cheated .
I realize he still have needs for sex and I allow him to enjoy himself even though I am not getting any gratification .
Her first husband wanted , maybe demanded sex , she says , every day .
Once we were married , she told me that she had to have sex with him every day and that would not be happening with us .
Wanting to respect the fact that she came out of such a demanding relationship , I backed off and decided to let her let me know when sex was okay .
We typically have had sex 3-5 times per years for the last 20 years and I feel it has really taken its toll on me as a man .
After several years and having had sex only a handful of times , it was obvious that me being patient and waiting for her to initiate sex at the level she felt comfortable with , was not going to happen .
Otherwise she felt like I was just wanting her for the sex .
I admit that I wasn ’ t vocal about things like telling her she was beautiful or complimenting her hair or clothes , etc. , but I felt like If I wanted to have sex that night , I had to start in the morning dropping all of these hints and comments for there to be a chance .
The problem was that maybe I didn ’ t know at breakfast that I would want sex badly enough that night to finally work up the courage to try something .
I turned to porn .
She made it clear that her first husband was addicted to porn , etc .
Any time she went to a women ’ s retreat , or women ’ s ministry , I prayed with all my being that part of the conversation would be about a woman ’ s obligation to be having sex with her husband or how a woman who is sexual with her husband can make him stronger , more confident and frankly more of what a man should be and was created to be .
A couple of weeks ago , she said God revealed to her , after 20 years , that she should apologize for not trusting me with sex I when we got married .
I don ’ t want to go to counceling , because I don ’ t want to talk about my wife ’ s and my sex life with another man and I don ’ t trust a woman to understand , because Christian women ( not you obviously ) don ’ t seem to want to face their responsibility of being sexual partners to their husbands , let alone aggressively pursuing sex with him .
After having employees not show up and having to pull an unexpected shift at the restaurant after church yesterday , I had hoped that our talk would have made her resolve to figuring out how to be a wife who pleases her husband sexually .
Instead , she spent the time being upset , and now my opening up to her and telling her what 20 years of scant sex has done to me , has become about how much she is hurt by what I said .
I believe that any spouse who withhold sex willfully will answer to God for this .
In marriage , being sexually connected is sometimes a challenge due to a lot of things .
Also I have noticed that good Christian women who start blogs to try and help wives understand they should participate more in sex with their husbands are under attack from WOMEN .

Now she saves her cervix has moved and that an orgasm from intercourse is not possible .
Sex is no longer fun I have been married for 15 years from but sexual intimacy has been a myriad in my marriage .
I have been the one always wanting an intimacy , always initiating , sex , kissing , hug etc because I love my wife and I don ’ t want to sin against God , but my wife has never been so particular about that .
Whenever I initiate sex move that is when she we remember the time I did something to her .
Tragic for me that my wife checked out from sexual intimacy on 1/2/2015 .
My best sex was when I was still lost .
Yes it was sin but the women were each so into giving and receiving sexually .
I don ’ t feel any better about not having sex with my wife but at least now I know where to find a lot of company !
No hugs , kisses , no ‘ I love you ” and when sex was offered , it was always missionary sex on her back without so much as “ hmmmm , that feels good ” .

Why is it acceptable to preach against sex when it ’ s wrong but not for sex when it is right ?
One reason there is so much perversion in society today is because Pastors have been silent on encouraging sex in marriage .
Hence people who are suppose to have sex do not , and people who are not suppose to have sex are , we have given satan lead way to deceive people .

attraction can ’ t be faked or created out of thin air DeCaff says : I was never sexually pleased !

We never had sex before being married , so after that day he thought sex was disgusting and humans should never have sex or intimacy .
We did have sex a couple of times then he decided he had enough .
So I was informed that he no longer was going to bother with sex any more and he was moving his things to our basement and I was to leave him alone , don ’ t talk to him again .

Defiance and the speakability of rape : Decolonizing trauma studies in Mahasweta Devi 's short fiction This article considers traumatic representations of violence in the stories of the Bengali writer Mahasweta Devi that do not readily fit into trauma studies discourses which emphasise the aporia and unspeakability of trauma .
The article explores the complex ways in which the trope of rape operates in Devi 's work and posits that it is used by Devi to empower her female protagonists and make them powerful critiques of patriarchal systems of exploitation .
In these stories , rape functions at two levels : firstly , it functions as a critique of the stark reality and extent of the violence perpetrated daily on the bodies of women ; secondly , it works as a trope in which the violation of the woman 's body becomes symptomatic of the violation of the land and its oppressed people by the ruling elite under decolonization .
Thus , rape in Devi 's fiction can be read allegorically as a critique from within of nationalism and decolonization .
By constituting the female subaltern as a complex figure of femininity whose body is not simply the site of exploitation and torture , but a transformative figure of resistance , Devi 's fiction radically destabilizes the basic premise of female vulnerability and the violent objectification of women in the context of rape as well as the expected traumatic aftermath .

Frank Augstein/Associated Press LONDON — The Swedish authorities announced on Tuesday that they would end an investigation into allegations of rape and sexual assault made against Julian Assange , the embattled WikiLeaks founder , that date from 2010 .
Sweden began investigating Mr. Assange in 2010 , after two women accused him of assaulting them during separate sexual encounters while he was visiting Stockholm .

Canceled musician Ryan Adams pens apology for hurting women Singer-songwriter Ryan Adams in his Hollywood music studio ( Jay Clendenin/Los Angeles Times ) By Anousha SakouiStaff Writer After multiple women , including several high-profile musical collaborators and at least one then-underage fan , accused Ryan Adams of sexual misconduct and abusive behavior last year , the singer-songwriter shared an apology online Friday .
Adams , who last year denied allegations in a New York Times expose that he sexually harassed women , claiming he would help their careers , said he was sober and had secured professional help .
Adams ’ ex-wife , Mandy Moore , singer-songwriter Phoebe Bridgers and a now-20-year-old fan , reported to have exchanged sexually explicit messages with Adams as a minor , are among those who say he engaged in a years-long pattern of promising professional advancement alongside sexual advances , only to turn manipulative and abusive .
Male model Jason Boyce accuses Bruce Weber of sexual harassment and discrimination By Rosemary Feitelberg | WWD After weeks of rumblings that high-profile fashion photographers were about to be admonished for sexual harassment , a complaint has been filed against Bruce Weber by model Jason Boyce , who says the photographer forced him to rub his own genitals .
In the filing , Boyce alleged to have suffered from being sexually harassed and discriminated against on the basis of his gender .
While Weber ’ s office did not respond to requests for comment , the photographer had addressed the problem of sexual harassment in more general terms a few weeks ago .
Asked by WWD about what was believed to be a New York Times story in development about sexual harassment in the fashion industry , Eva Lindemann-Sánchez , producer of Little Bear Inc. , said , “ Bruce believes everyone should , at all times , be treated fairly , correctly and with respect. ” Boyce ’ s attorney , Mark Risk of The Bloom Firm , did not respond to a request for comment .
Weber is the second high-profile photographer to be called out for reports of sexual misconduct in recent months .
However , no amount of talent can excuse sexual harassment , therefore if the allegations in the lawsuit are true , the industry should react as it did with Terry Richardson , and do so swiftly , ” said Kim Vernon , president and chief executive officer of The Vernon Company , a consulting firm .
It is important that companies adopt policies and provide training to personnel so they can identify , report , and stop any potential situation where a person is sexually compromised , ” she said .
The news of Weber ’ s alleged sexual harassment and sexual discrimination broke just a day after Def Jam cofounder Russell Simmons permanently stepped down from his businesses .

A Tennessee school board removed the graphic novel ‘ Maus , ’ about the Holocaust , from curriculum due to language and nudity concerns By Chris Boyette , CNN 'Maus ' author reacts to his book being pulled from curriculum “ Maus , ” the Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel about the experiences of Holocaust survivors that was recently banned by a Tennessee school board , has made the Amazon best-seller list .
Earlier this month , “ Maus ” was removed from an eighth-grade English language arts curriculum by the McMinn County , Tennessee , Board of Education over concerns about “ rough , objectionable language ” and a drawing of a nude woman .

A holy virgin consecrates herself , or himself , to the Lord fully — in body , mind , and spirit — not because there is something inherently impure about human sexuality within marriage , but solely because she or he is called by God to this unique expression of full Gospel self-sacrifice .
Male and female were , in the beginning , made for one another , and human sexuality was and is part of that , part of what was pronounced good by God within the context of marriage .
The Church has sometimes gotten that wrong , has sometimes looked upon sex as somehow inherently degraded .
If God has not given you the gift of sexual self-control , then God has not called you to perpetual holy virginity .
But , if self-restraint is God ’ s gift to you — self-restraint and the ability to live without the emotional and physical intimacy of marriage — and if you wish to make a sacrifice of your sexuality , of that human intimacy , then that , too , is honorable and holy .

Early roots of sexual-orientation health disparities : associations between sexual attraction , health and well-being in a national sample of Australian adolescents http : //orcid.org/0000-0001-7508-9431Francisco Perales , Institute for Social Science Research , The University of Queensland , Brisbane , Queensland , Australia Correspondence to Dr Francisco Perales , Institute for Social Science Research , The University of Queensland , Brisbane 4068 , Queensland , Australia ; f.perales { at } uq.edu.au Background Research documents substantial adolescent health disparities by sexual orientation , but studies are confined to a small number of countries—chiefly the USA .
We provide first-time evidence of associations between sexual orientation and adolescent health/well-being in a new country—Australia .
We also add to knowledge by examining health/well-being outcomes not previously analysed in national samples , considering adolescents reporting no sexual attractions , and rank-ordering sexual-orientation health disparities by magnitude .
Methods Data from an Australian national probability sample of 14/15 years old ( Longitudinal Study of Australian Children , n=3318 ) and regression models adjusted for confounding and for multiple comparisons were used to examine the associations between sexual attraction and 30 outcomes spanning multiple domains of health/well-being—including socio-emotional functioning , health-related quality of life , depressive symptoms , health-related behaviours , social support , self-harm , suicidality , victimisation , self-concept , school belonging and global health/well-being assessments .

A Sexual Abuse Case Is Tearing Apart The Catholic Church In India A wall of silence surrounds the death of a key witness in a huge rape scandal .
Many fear that one of the biggest scandals to hit the Catholic Church will be buried with the priest — because Kuriakose was a key witness in a case in which a powerful bishop has been accused of raping a nun .
Around the world , the Catholic Church has been beset by sex abuse crimes in recent years , with allegations often initially dismissed before finally being addressed .
The last decade has seen the Vatican move from insisting other religions are just “ as rife with abuse ” and accusing victims of slander , to the pope condemning these crimes and “ begging forgiveness. ” But this continues to be little more than lip service — this November , the Vatican vetoed plans by US bishops to meet and address sexual abuse .
Victims of sexual abuse have found it almost impossible to get their allegations taken seriously , let alone bring them before a court .
Change has been slow , and painful : This year , four priests from Kerala , a southern state in India , have been accused of sex crimes .
Now many Catholics are waiting to see what happens in the biggest case of all — earlier this fall , Bishop Franco Mulakkal , the man accused of raping the nun , became the first Indian bishop to ever be arrested .
Other nuns who supported their sister after she accused the bishop of rape have said they are afraid for their lives since Kuriakose ’ s death .
The nun who accused Mulakkal of raping her was also a member of the southern chapter of the same congregation .
He said he was in “ painful agony ” and was a victim of blackmail — in the past , he said he had initiated disciplinary action against the nun for violating religious vows , disobedience , and having sexual relations with a man .
Finally , the Missionaries of Jesus handed out a photograph of the nun at a press conference , despite laws in India protecting the anonymity of rape survivors .
On Sept. 22 Mulakkal was arrested on suspicion of rape .
The allegations of rape against him are still under investigation .
On Twitter , right-wing Hindu nationalist trolls have used the story as a way to deflect attention from other sexual abuse allegations , or even accuse “ liberals ” in the media of trying to “ cover up ” the church ’ s sins .
Responding to the “ how are you ’ s ” with “ good ” and “ fine ” which we all know is a load of crock , but we all got shit to do and it ’ s that much easier to miss or ignore .

New statewide survey hopes to capture 'lived experiences ' of sexual assault victims Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy The New Jersey Coalition Against Sexual Assault launched a statewide survey last week for survivors of sexual violence , believed to be the first-ever large-scale survey of victims in the Garden State .
The survey is designed to help government agencies and policy makers understand the full extent of a victim 's needs and experiences because only a small number of sexual assaults — an estimated 230 out of every 1000 — are reported to police , according to the Rape Abuse and Incest National Network .
The Coalition Against Sexual Assault is statewide advocacy organization established in 1981 that represents the 21 county-based rape crisis centers , and the Rutgers University Office of Violence Prevention and Victim Assistance .
Throughout the next few months , the coalition will also be conducting additional interviews with survivors of sexual violence for additional context .
The responses will be used to guide policy development , identify gaps in services and create better outcomes for the survivors of sexual violence in the state , said Teffenhart .
People who live in the state of New Jersey , are age 18 or older , and identify as a survivor or victim of sexual violence are invited to participate .

Can you have sex on bed rest if you 're not doing any of the work ?
There are few activities allowed while on bed rest during pregnancy , according to the University of Washington Medical Center , and unfortunately , sex is n't one of them .
Beyond simple intercourse , the website noted that sexual stimulation , nipple stimulation , and essentially anything approaching a sexually arousing activity should be avoided during the period of bed rest .
It will feel 10 times longer than however long it lasts , it 's 100 times more boring than you expect it will be , and your butt will absolutely go numb several times a day regardless of how many times you change positions .
When I asked about sex during bed rest , she explains that any form of sexual stimulation or induction of arousal is off-limits .
`` You do n't want anything that could possibly stimulate contractions , and both orgasm and sexual activity that falls short of climax can induce contractions in the mom 's body . ''
Shurnberg notes that in normal pregnancies , this is n't a cause for concern — you have sex , you might have cramping or contractions that do n't cause any problems .

So you ’ ve heard that a tongue vibrator can help you enjoy better sex and are wondering if it is something you should have .
The first thing you need to think about when purchasing a vibrator is how big you want it to be .
Another thing to consider is what you want to do with your tongue vibrator .
Some women use them in their mouths , while others use them in their tongues or even their anus .
Some women prefer the intense feeling that comes from using their vibrators on their tongue , while others want the external stimulation of a vibrator on their member ’ s tip .

Categorically , sexual violence , child marriage , female genital mutilation , trafficking for sexual exploitation , female infanticide , and ‘ honour ’ crimes remain common in many societies .
These are just snapshots of many life stories that women and girls experience when they are deprived of access to basic services such as sexual and reproductive health .
The inability to access such essential services puts women at a greater risk of unplanned pregnancy , maternal mortality and morbidity , severe sexual and reproductive injuries , and contracting sexually transmitted infections .
In order to alleviate suffering , UN organisations need to advocate for ending sexual violence against women and meeting the needs of women and girls , through raising awareness , increasing accessibility to healthcare including sexual and reproductive health services , and enforcing regulations that serve and protect females .

Animal rights activists , including Goodall , want writers — who take guidance from the Associated Press Stylebook — to stop referring to an animal as “ it. ” Here ’ s the AP ’ s entry on animals : Do not apply a personal pronoun to an animal unless its sex has been established or the animal has a name : The dog was scared ; it barked .
`` ﻿﻿ They ’ re suggesting that the guidance should be to use she/her/hers and he/him/his when an animal ’ s sex is known , and the gender-neutral they , or he/she , or his/hers when sex is unknown.﻿﻿ “ By avoiding the inaccurate use of the word it , this update would reflect the fact that nonhuman animals are sentient beings , and encourage dialogue about how to respect and protect them and their rights and interests , and to shape a more equitable world , ” said Debra Merskin , journalism and communication professor at the University of Oregon and co-author of Animals & Media .
Since traditional Armenian culture is intolerant of any discussion of issues pertaining to sexual rights of women , divorce or domestic violence , the crime is severely underreported and rarely prosecuted .
In Armenia , the first question asked by police , prosecutors and judges to women sexually assaulted by their husbands is often “ What did you do to encourage this ? ” ( Amnesty International , 2008 ) .
“ [ Violence ] takes the form of brute physical force , beatings , sexual torture ( including being forced to engage in sexual activity against one ’ s will ) , authoritarian control ( imprisoning the victim in the home , controlling contacts with others including family members , controlling all finances including access to food and clothing , etc . )
Due to strong social pressure on victims to preserve silence on domestic and sexual violence , there is a risk that these crimes and violations of women ’ s rights are both significantly under-reported and perpetrated with widespread impunity in Armenia .
“ In 1998 , the Women ’ s Rights Center in [ the capital city of ] Yerevan surveyed one hundred women and found that forty six had experienced some form of violence in the family , including sexual violence .

To take one example of a dominant idea on campuses , Queer Theory sounds radical because it fundamentally and avowedly rejects the ‘ norm ’ when it comes to issues of gender and sexuality .
However , Yola Kipcak of Der Funke , the IMT in Austria , compellingly showed in her presentation ‘ Marxism vs. Queer Theory ’ that , behind the radical phrases , there is little of use in this ideological trend if we really want to overcome gender oppression and move to a society where we can decide for ourselves about our bodies and sexuality .

This may be one of the most concentrated samples of bullshit I 've ever seen .
Of course , that does n't mean you need to sympathize with the motivation the villain has , whether it be money , sex , power , revenge , or whatever .
For example , I find this villain one of the most deeply repulsive characters ever invented , because what motivates her is pure sadism : But it works because we 've all known people like her , who use their power to hurt people simply because they can , who take pleasure in making their subordinates ' lives miserable -- and because of that twist in their personality , a frightening number of them become bosses , teachers , and political leaders .
On the other hand , I still fucking loathe Dolores Umbridge .

Thirdly , the authors argue that because those who are aged 70 or over are statistically at a higher risk of dying that this justifies the policy to keep them in lockdown for an extended period of time : It is using age like sex [ for breast cancer screening ] as a basis for a medical decision only because that feature correlates with a robust statistically higher likelihood of getting ill .
So why do they think that it is okay for people to be locked down on the basis of age but not sex or ethnicity ?

It ’ s very realistic , sexual assault happens everyday , unfortunately .
The men and women on sex offender probation have no choice about their identities .
They are sex offenders , solely and clearly .
Other people are the sum of their experiences but sex offenders are the sum of their crimes .
Even if not in prison , they are always sex offenders to their communities .
It is much easier to accept this as your identity than to fight the people who emphasize every week , every day , that you are only a sex offender .
( To be clear , I speak here about a group of women who had consensual sexual contact with male teenagers and are on probation .
Status as a sex offender takes precedence in every single situation , even one where someone ’ s life is in danger .
That would be callous , the kind of monstrosity expected from sex offenders just because they are sex offenders .
I wanted to change my name but that ’ s not allowed when you ’ re a sex offender .
Even a glimmer of self-worth contradicts the unspoken maxim : you are a sex offender .
If sex offender treatment programs do not radically change the way they view their clients , they will continue hurting women offenders and their communities rather than healing them .

I went first to Uganda to teach the Comfort International Ministry School ( CIMS ) module on marriage family and sex , as well as to take a two day marriage retreat .

He would , for this purpose , leave his horse tied up in the woods .
In Exodus and Revolution , Walzer points out ( at least I think he does ; it ’ s been a while ) that one of the elements that made bondage in ancient Egypt bondage was the fact that the slaves had to work so much .
In Genesis 16:9 an angel of the Lord says to a slave who just escaped with her child from abuse , “ Return to thy mistress , and submit thyself under her hands. ” Passover wasn ’ t about liberation from bondage , it was about the liberation of the people Israel from bondage .

Defining women as a collective can be another challenging aspect , women can be significantly different , situated knowledge , personal experiences , which reflect social , cultural and historical location and intersectionality “ a perspective on inequality which argues that oppressions of race , class , gender , and sexuality can not be understood in isolation from one another , but instead “ intersect ” and help mutually reinforce and shape one another. ” ( Routledge , 2016 ) make this complex topic so vast it seems impossible to measure .
“ An aim of research is to identify and challenge ideas and practices that support discrimination against people on the basis of their ethnic background , age , gender , sexuality , disability , and so on .
De Beauvoir also focused on how control of women ’ s sexuality and reproduction has historically subjugated them to men , and was one of the first theorists to argue that gender was not an essential characteristic of people , but rather something that one becomes through socialization. ” ( Routledge , 2016 ) .

During a typical circumcision , the shaft of the man ’ s penis is freed from its head , and then the foreskin is neatly removed by clipping it off with clippers .
The procedure begins with medical personnel removing the penis from the head with a sterile scalpel .

Naming Our Abuse : God ’ s Pathways to Healing for Male Sexual Abuse Survivors Naming Our Abuse : God ’ s Pathways to Healing for Male Sexual Abuse Survivors ( Kregel , April 2016 ) A stunningly vulnerable look at the horrific realities of sexual abuse and how to overcome them.Male sexual abuse is increasingly in the news , from scandals in the Catholic Church to exploitations at Penn State .
( p.39 ) Naming Our Abuse follows the stories of three men who are survivors of childhood sexual abuse .
If you are a male sexual abuse survivor you may find that you relate to much of what the authors have written and gain a further understanding of of yourself in the process .
I really don ’ t know of too many resources like this book available today and believe this book does an excellent job of helping male sexual abuse survivors survey the wreckage in their own lives and take steps toward healing and toward repairing their relationship with God as well .
He writes about integrative issues surrounding abuse , trauma , lament , and spiritual formation and speaks regularly on issues of sexual abuse .

In the human reproductive process , two kinds of sex cells , or gametes ( pronounced : GAH-meetz ) , are involved .
The male has reproductive organs , or genitals , that are both inside and outside the pelvis .
The male genitals include : the testicles ( pronounced : TESS-tih-kulz ) the duct system , which is made up of the epididymis and the vas deferens the accessory glands , which include the seminal vesicles and prostate gland In a guy who has reached sexual maturity , the two oval-shaped testicles , or testes ( pronounced : TESS-teez ) make and store millions of tiny sperm cells .
The urethra ( pronounced : yoo-REE-thruh ) is the channel that carries the sperm ( in fluid called semen ) to the outside of the body through the penis .
The penis is actually made up of two parts : the shaft and the glans .
The shaft is the main part of the penis and the glans is the tip ( sometimes called the head ) .
At the end of the glans is a small slit or opening , which is where semen and pee exit the body through the urethra .
The inside of the penis is made of a spongy tissue that can expand and contract .
The penis is made of two parts : the shaft ( the main part ) and the glans ( the tip , sometimes called the head ) .
The two testicles ( or testes ) produce sperm and the male sex hormone testosterone .
The prostate gland is a walnut-sized gland that surrounds a portion of the urethra and produces some of the fluid in semen .
The urethra is the tube that carries semen and urine out of the penis .
All boys are born with a foreskin , a fold of skin at the end of the penis covering the glans .
The male reproductive system : makes semen ( pronounced : SEE-mun ) releases semen into the reproductive system of the female during sexual intercourse produces sex hormones , which help a boy develop into a sexually mature man during puberty When a baby boy is born , he has all the parts of his reproductive system in place , but it is n't until puberty that he is able to reproduce .
Next , the penis becomes longer and the seminal vesicles and prostate gland grow .
The seminal vesicles and prostate gland make a whitish fluid called seminal fluid , which mixes with sperm to form semen when a male is sexually stimulated .
The penis , which usually hangs limp , becomes hard when a male is sexually excited .
Tissues in the penis fill with blood and it becomes stiff and erect ( an erection ) .
The rigidity of the erect penis makes it easier to insert into the female 's vagina during sex .
When the erect penis is stimulated , muscles around the reproductive organs contract and force the semen through the duct system and urethra .
Semen is pushed out of the male 's body through his urethra — this process is called ejaculation .
If semen is ejaculated into a female 's vagina , millions of sperm `` swim '' up from the vagina through the cervix and uterus to meet the egg in the fallopian tube .

Wang Xiao , a commentator of Shanghai-based news website guancha.cn , who studied politics and history in the US for years , told the Global Times that the political elites of the US have always used `` identity politics '' to divide the lower class since the Cold War era , so that they can shift the conflict between classes into a conflict between different minorities or religious groups or people of different sexual orientation , thus makes it easy for elites to maintain their advantage in a capitalist system .
When the partners in her office later refused to repropose her for partnership , she sued petitioner in Federal District Court under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , charging that it had discriminated against her on the basis of sex in its partnership decisions .
The District Court ruled in respondent 's favor on the question of liability , holding that petitioner had unlawfully discriminated against her on the basis of sex by consciously giving credence and effect to partners ' comments about her that resulted from sex stereotyping .
sex , '' requires looking at all of the reasons , both legitimate and illegitimate , contributing to the decision at the time it is made .
( c ) The District Court 's finding that sex stereotyping was permitted to play a part in evaluating respondent as a candidate for partnership was not clearly erroneous .
JUSTICE O'CONNOR , although agreeing that on the facts of this case , the burden of persuasion should shift to petitioner to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision absent consideration of respondent 's gender , and that this burden shift is properly part of the liability phase of the litigation , concluded that the plurality misreads Title VII 's substantive causation requirement to command burden shifting if the employer 's decisional process is [ 490 U.S. 228 , 230 ] `` tainted '' by awareness of sex or race in any way , and thereby effectively eliminates the requirement .
2000e et seq. , charging that the firm had discriminated against her on the basis of sex in its decisions regarding partnership .
Dr. Susan Fiske , a social psychologist and Associate Professor of Psychology at Carnegie-Mellon University , testified at trial that the partnership selection process at Price Waterhouse was likely influenced by sex stereotyping .
According to [ 490 U.S. 228 , 236 ] Fiske , Hopkins ' uniqueness ( as the only woman in the pool of candidates ) and the subjectivity of the evaluations made it likely that sharply critical remarks such as these were the product of sex stereotyping - although Fiske admitted that she could not say with certainty whether any particular comment was the result of stereotyping .
He held that Price Waterhouse had unlawfully discriminated against Hopkins on the basis of sex by consciously giving credence and effect to partners ' comments that resulted from sex stereotyping .
[ 490 U.S. 228 , 239 ] In passing Title VII , Congress made the simple but momentous announcement that sex , race , religion , and national origin are not relevant to the selection , evaluation , or compensation of employees .
sex . ''
When , therefore , an employer considers both gender and legitimate factors at the time of making a decision , that decision was `` because of '' sex and the other , legitimate considerations - even if we may say later , in the context of litigation , that the decision would have been the same if gender had not been taken into account .
The intent to drive employers to focus on qualifications rather than on race , religion , sex , or national origin is the theme of a good deal of the statute 's legislative history .
The memorandum went on : `` To discriminate is to make a distinction , to make a difference in treatment or favor , and those distinctions or differences in treatment or favor which are prohibited by section 704 are those which are based on any five of the forbidden criteria : race , color , religion , sex , and national origin .
In a related context , although the Equal Pay Act expressly permits employers to pay different wages to women where disparate pay is the result of a `` factor other than sex , '' see 29 U.S.C .
206 ( d ) ( 1 ) , we have decided that it is the employer , not the employee , who must prove that the actual disparity is not sex linked .
13 In the specific context of sex stereotyping , an employer who acts on the basis of a belief that a woman can not be aggressive , or that she must not be , has acted on the basis of gender .
Although the parties do not overtly dispute this last proposition , the placement by Price Waterhouse of `` sex stereotyping '' in quotation marks throughout its brief seems to us an insinuation either that such stereotyping was not present in this case or that it lacks legal relevance .
[ 490 U.S. 228 , 251 ] As to the existence of sex stereotyping in this case , we are not inclined to quarrel with the District Court 's conclusion that a number of the partners ' comments showed sex stereotyping at work .
As for the legal relevance of sex stereotyping , we are beyond the day when an employer could evaluate employees by assuming or insisting that they matched the stereotype associated with their group , for `` ` [ i ] n forbidding employers to discriminate against individuals because of their sex , Congress intended to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women resulting from sex stereotypes . ' ''
Remarks at work that are based on sex stereotypes do not inevitably prove that gender played a part in a particular employment decision .
On the contrary , Hopkins proved that Price Waterhouse invited partners to submit comments ; that some of the comments stemmed from sex stereotypes ; that an important part of the Policy Board 's decision on Hopkins was an assessment of the submitted comments ; and that Price Waterhouse in no way disclaimed reliance on the sex-linked evaluations .
The District Court found that sex stereotyping `` was permitted to play a part '' in the evaluation of Hopkins as a candidate for partnership .
In finding that some of the partners ' comments reflected sex stereotyping , the District Court relied in part on Dr. Fiske 's expert testimony .
Without directly impugning Dr. Fiske 's credentials or qualifications , Price Waterhouse insinuates that a social psychologist is unable to identify sex stereotyping in evaluations without investigating whether those evaluations have a basis in reality .
Without contradiction from Price Waterhouse , Fiske testified that she discerned sex stereotyping in the partners ' evaluations of Hopkins , and she further explained that it was part of her business to identify stereotyping in written documents .
We are not inclined to accept petitioner 's belated and unsubstantiated characterization of Dr. Fiske 's testimony as `` gossamer evidence '' ( Brief for Petitioner 20 ) based only on `` intuitive hunches '' ( id. , at 44 ) and of her detection of sex stereotyping as `` intuitively divined '' ( id. , at 43 ) .
It takes no special training to discern sex stereotyping in a description of an aggressive female employee as requiring `` a course at charm school . ''
Nor , turning to Thomas Beyer 's memorable advice to Hopkins , does it require expertise in psychology to know that , if an employee 's flawed `` interpersonal skills '' can be corrected by a soft-hued suit or a new shade of lipstick , perhaps it is the employee 's sex and not her interpersonal skills that has drawn the criticism .
15 Price Waterhouse also charges that Hopkins produced no evidence that sex stereotyping played a role in the decision to place her candidacy on hold .
Nor is the finding that sex stereotyping played a part in the Policy Board 's decision undermined by the fact that many of the suspect comments were made by supporters rather than detractors of Hopkins .
[ Footnote 5 ] In this Court , Hopkins for the first time argues that Price Waterhouse violated 703 ( a ) ( 2 ) when it subjected her to a biased decision-making process that `` tended to deprive '' a woman of partnership on the basis of her sex .
The somewhat bizarre path by which `` sex '' came to be included as a forbidden criterion for employment - it was included in an attempt to defeat the bill , see C. & B. Whalen , The Longest Debate : A Legislative History of the 1964 Civil Rights Act 115-117 ( 1985 ) - does not persuade us that the legislators ' statements pertaining to race are irrelevant to cases alleging gender discrimination .
The amendment that added `` sex '' as one of the forbidden criteria for employment was passed , of course , and the statute on its face treats each of the enumerated categories exactly the same .
[ Footnote 10 ] Hopkins argues that once she made this showing , she was entitled to a finding that Price Waterhouse had discriminated against her on the basis of sex ; as a consequence , she says , the partnership 's proof could only limit the relief she received .
employment or advancement [ 490 U.S. 228 , 245 ] or was suspended or discharged for any reason other than discrimination on account of race , color , religion , sex , or national origin . ''
Finally , where liability is imposed because an employer is unable to prove that it would have made the same decision even if it had not discriminated , this is not an imposition of liability `` where sex made no difference to the outcome . ''
to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual , or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation , terms , conditions , or privileges of employment , because of such individual 's race , color , religion , sex , or national origin . ''
While the main concern of the statute was with employment opportunity , Congress was certainly not blind to the stigmatic harm which comes from being evaluated by a process which treats one as an inferior by reason of one 's race or sex .
This Court 's decisions under the Equal Protection Clause have long recognized that whatever the final outcome of a decisional process , the inclusion of race or sex as a consideration within it harms both society and the individual .
See , e. g. , Hervey v. Little Rock , 787 F.2d 1223 , 1233-1234 ( CA8 1986 ) ( applying Arlington Heights to public employee 's claim of sex discrimination in promotion decision ) ; Lee v. Russell County Bd .
Title VII expressly provides that an employer need not give preferential treatment to employees or applicants of any race , color , religion , sex , or national origin in order to maintain a work force in balance with the general population .
First , the explicit consideration of race , color , religion , sex , or national origin in making employment decisions `` was the most obvious evil Congress had in mind when it enacted Title VII . ''
To avoid bearing the burden of justifying its decision , the employer need not seek racial or sexual balance in its work force ; rather , all it need do is avoid substantial reliance on forbidden criteria in making its employment decisions .
Based on its misreading of [ 490 U.S. 228 , 276 ] the words `` because of '' in the statute , see ante , at 240-242 , the plurality appears to conclude that if a decisional process is `` tainted '' by awareness of sex or race in any way , the employer has violated the statute , and Title VII thus commands that the burden shift to the employer to justify its decision .
Thus , stray remarks in the workplace , while perhaps probative of sexual harassment , see Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson , 477 U.S. 57 , 63 -69 ( 1986 ) , can not justify requiring the employer to prove that its hiring or promotion decisions were based on legitimate criteria .
For example , in the context of this case , a mere reference to `` a lady candidate '' might show that gender `` played a role '' in the decision , but by no means could support a rational fact finder 's inference that the decision was made `` because of '' sex .
The part of the statute relevant to this case provides : '' It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer - '' ( 1 ) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual , or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation , terms , conditions , or privileges of employment , because of such individual 's race , color , religion , sex , or national origin . ''
Congress could not have chosen a clearer way [ 490 U.S. 228 , 282 ] to indicate that proof of liability under Title VII requires a showing that race , color , religion , sex , or national origin caused the decision at issue .
Thus we have said that providing different insurance coverage to male and female employees violates the statute by treating the employee `` ` in a manner which but-for that person 's sex would be different . ' ''
It is unlawful `` to fail '' or `` to refuse '' to provide employment benefits on the basis of sex , not `` to have failed '' or `` to have refused '' to have done so .
No one contends , however , that sex must be the sole cause of a decision before there is a Title VII violation .
This is a separate question from whether consideration of sex must be a cause of the decision .
Under the accepted approach to causation that I have discussed , sex is a cause for the employment decision whenever , either by itself or in combination with other factors , it made a difference to the decision .
The BFOQ provisions allow an employer , in certain cases , to make an employment decision of which it is conceded that sex is the cause .
That sex may be the legitimate cause of an employment decision where gender is a BFOQ is consistent with the opposite command [ 490 U.S. 228 , 285 ] that a decision caused by sex in any other case justifies the imposition of Title VII liability .
This principle does not support , however , the novel assertion that a violation has occurred where sex made no difference to the outcome .
an employer considers both gender and legitimate factors at the time of making a decision , that decision was ` because of ' sex and the other , legitimate considerations - even if we may say later , in the context of litigation , that the decision would have been the same if gender had not been taken into account . ''
Title VII unambiguously states that an employer who makes decisions `` because of '' sex has violated the statute .
But the opinion then tells us that the employer who shows that the same decision would have been made absent consideration of sex is not a violator .
If the second statement is to be reconciled with the language of Title VII , it must be that a decision that would have been the same absent consideration of sex was not made `` because of '' sex .
The opinion states that `` [ a ] court that finds for a plaintiff under this standard has effectively concluded that an illegitimate motive was a ` but-for ' cause of the employment decision , '' ante , at 249 , and that this `` is not an imposition of liability ` where sex made no difference to the outcome , ' '' ante , at 246 , n. 11 .
In the BFOQ context this is a sensible , indeed necessary , allocation of the burden , for there by definition sex is the but-for cause of the employment decision and the only question remaining is how the employer can justify it .
As the plurality notes , the District Court based its liability determination on expert evidence that some evaluations of respondent Hopkins were based on unconscious sex stereotypes , 5 and on the fact that [ 490 U.S. 228 , 294 ] Price Waterhouse failed to disclaim reliance on these comments when it conducted the partnership review .
Although the District Court 's version of Title VII liability is improper under any of today 's opinions , I think it important to stress that Title VII creates no independent cause of action for sex stereotyping .
Evidence of use by decision makers of sex stereotypes is , of course , quite relevant to the question of discriminatory intent .
Had the District Court found on this record that sex discrimination caused the adverse decision , I doubt it would have been reversible error .
That decision was for the finder of fact , however , and the District Court made plain that sex discrimination was not a but-for cause of the decision to place Hopkins ' partnership candidacy on hold .
The language of Title VII and our well-considered precedents require this plaintiff to establish that the decision to place her candidacy on hold was made `` because of '' sex .
Supp. , at 1118 , and that `` [ b ] ecause plaintiff has considerable problems dealing with staff and peers , the Court can not say that she would have been elected to partnership if the Policy Board 's decision had not been tainted by sexually based evaluations , '' id. , at 1120 .
Translated to the context of Title VII , this situation would arise where an employer took an adverse action in reliance both on sex and on legitimate reasons , and either the illegitimate or the legitimate reason standing alone would have produced the action .
Presumably it will be easier for a plaintiff to show that consideration of race or sex pursuant to an affirmative-action plan was a substantial factor in a decision , and the court will need to move on to the question of a plan 's validity .

Home Features Rowan ’ s Department of Philosophy and World Religions Hosts “ Theorizing : Tamsin Kimoto on ... Tamsin Kimoto , assistant professor of philosophy and women , gender and sexuality studies at Goucher College , discusses the topic of exclusionary feminism .
The event welcomed Tamsin Kimoto , an assistant professor of philosophy and women , gender and sexuality studies at Goucher College in Baltimore , Maryland , for the lecture .
Kimoto ’ s original intention with this lecture was to “ push back ” on the “ sexual prudeness of contemporary feminism ” and develop a form of feminism that celebrates sex .
One of the act ’ s key aspects was a ban on immigration for the purposes of sex work , which Kimoto said effectively became a “ blanket ban ” on immigration for women of East Asian descent .
“ Asian women then enter into U.S. law as prostitutes , ” Kimoto said , describing passages from the act , “ and are therefore excluded from the possibility of even entering into the borders of the country. ” Kimoto went on to explain that , although some of the text sounds like a wide-ranging policy , its placement in the Page Act makes it clear that the main source of sex workers that the United States was concerned about were those coming from East Asia .
Kimoto described some of the strategies of carceral feminism , such as using “ sex trafficking ” to refer to all sex work , and collaborating with policy makers to pass stricter regulations around forms of consensual sex work , like pornography .
She stated that TERFs – trans exclusionary radical feminists – are another example of hygienic feminism , claiming that these types of radical feminists have turned feminism ’ s energy against transgender women and sex workers , given that they view both groups as images of “ bad ” women .

We have to call people “ him ” and “ her ” even if we believe that people ’ s genders are determined by their biological sex and not by their self-perceptions — perceptions that , by the way , can rapidly change , for those who are “ gender-fluid ” — and that using terms tied to self-perception is basically a lie .
Both sex and religious discrimination are , after all , prohibited by the same laws ; by the City ’ s logic , if you call a Catholic priest “ Father , ” you ’ d have to use whatever other self-chosen religious titles people insist on .
Nor is this likely to stay in New York City : The New York officials are arguing that this is just what the New York gender identity discrimination ban requires , and indeed it is part of the standard ideology expressed by many transgender rights activists ; the same logic would be easily applicable by jurisdictions that have gender identity discrimination bans , or will have such bans ; the federal government is taking the view that existing federal bans on sex discrimination also in effect ban gender identity discrimination , and the New York analysis would equally apply to that view ; and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has already taken the view that it is illegal under federal law to persistently call employees by pronouns that correspond to their anatomical sex but not their gender identity , though it has not yet had occasion to opine about “ ze. ” Feel uncomfortable about being forced to use terms that express social status views ( “ Milord ” ) or religious views ( “ Your Holiness ” ) that you may not endorse ?

`` Divine Power in a Hidden Way : Thomas ' Commentary on the Sentences IV '' July 2nd - July 14th in Norcia , Italy Sex education , sexual exploitation Not long ago I posted on this blog about how sex education which focuses on consent and ignores all other aspects of sexual morality opens children up to abuse .
This focuses on the corrosive nature of the sex ed ideology not only on the children , but on those charged with their care .
A serious case review published by the Bristol Safeguarding Children Board last year notes ‘ an underlying confusion for practitioners in distinguishing between underage but consensual sexual activity between peers and child sexual abuse and sexual exploitation ’ .
It is rather ‘ rooted in the complex and contradictory cultural , legal and moral norms around sexuality , and in particular teenage sexual experimentation ’ .
The same theme features in the 2015 serious case review into child sexual exploitation in Oxfordshire .
The Oxfordshire report further states that : ‘ [ T ] here was…an acceptance of a degree of underage sexual activity that reflects a wider societal reluctance to consider something “ wrong ” , ’ and argues that ‘ action to prevent harm ’ should always take precedence over ‘ action to be non-judgmental ’ .
It also makes it harder for professionals to have the confidence and bravery to be more proactive on prevention and intervention. ’ In the light of these observations from the serious case reviews , we should be wary of any approach to sex and relationships education that is reluctant to declare anything ‘ wrong ’ .
Now they see the West as having lost its ethics , especially on sexual questions .

There is a lot this weekend in the Catholic press and online about a proposal to establish mandatory sex education in schools for children from the age of four .
The problems can be summarised under three headings : the content of typical sex education ; the classroom context in which this education is delivered ; and the role of the state vis-a-vis parents .
on BBC Radio Cardiff ( listen here ) , who campaigns for sex education ( sounds an interesting job ) , tried to reassure listeners about the proposal by saying that , of course , it would be 'age appropriate ' .
Four-year-olds would not be told about sex positions , but about 'holding hands ' , and asked about whether they were comfortable with people holding their hands and so on .
At 62 years of age , many almost-fatalities under his belt , his physical being an undoubted and damaged mass of perpetual ache and trauma , you ’ d be an asshole to blame him .

For the early period , from his first formulation of psychoanalysis in 1895 through to the outbreak of the First World War , Freud concentrated on the sexual nature of many or most of these urges , and the psychic mechanisms by which human beings try to repress or control them ( via psychological techniques such as displacement or repression ) .
But the experience of the Great War made Freud change his theory in recognition of the vast role he now thought was played by violence and a Death Drive , which matched and sometimes overcame the sex urge .

One such usage appeared in a trial testimony implicating a woman as an accessory to a crime for which her husband was charged : But if you dare to raise your arm , to unsex yourself and engage in a conspiracy against the nation ’ s life and the nation ’ s honor , to make a widow of one of your own sex , to strike down the father and husband in the presence of his wife and child , I call upon this honest jury of my countrymen to spurn that spirit of mawkish sentimentality .

Women ’ s participation in illicit activities such as theft , robbery , assault , or murder were generally sensationalized in both trial and newspaper records , giving such accounts a sexual tinge no matter how seemingly mundane .
There are many important inquiries in this area for historians of gender and sexuality working at the intersection of race and slavery .

One such talk , given last year in San Francisco , was one that we knew was going to be controversial from the outset because it was going to take us into entirely new territory… not only at TEDWomen but also online as men and women in every part of the world are struggling to come to terms with the global epidemic of sexual violence .
In this groundbreaking duet TED Talk , we heard the story of an extraordinary partnership that developed between a victim of sexual violence and her perpetrator — as they each searched for a path to understanding and forgiveness .
As my friend recounted the plan Thordis had come up with to begin an online dialogue with Tom ( who had been an exchange student from Australia ) , I could begin to see the potential for a TED Talk that would reveal a new possibility for millions of victims of sexual violence .
This was new territory — a rapist standing on a stage next to the woman he raped , telling their story of reconciliation and forgiveness together , to the world .
Many times , it wasn ’ t clear if they and their families ( both had life partners ) would go forward , but the more they wrote and talked and put their discoveries about themselves and about the nature of sexual crimes , the more they felt compelled to share it , hoping that it might provide a new path to healing for others .
I was almost as nervous as they were when they took the stage in San Francisco , knowing that it was potentially explosive to have a confessed perpetrator of a sexual crime standing in front of an audience who most certainly included many victims of similar violence .
One of every three women experiences sexual violence in her lifetime .
Thordis tells me that the book has received many favorable reviews , including one review in the UK Sunday Times she particularly appreciated that said : “ Hats off to Elva and Stranger for a brave journey that might well change lives. ” “ Public speaking has been a major part of what I do for the past decade and in the months to come , I ’ ll be speaking to a wide range of people — including police officers , shelter workers and politicians — about sexual violence , breaking the silence that surrounds it , healing from it and lifting the shame from survivors .
I ’ ve also been tending to my other passion , which is battling online abuse , including the non-consensual distribution of nude photos. ” Their talk has provoked strong reactions — for instance , after a petition drive this spring , a scheduled talk in London was cancelled , and instead became a more intimate facilitated conversation .
This fall , Thordis is releasing a short film for teenagers , “ reminding them of the importance of consent in any type of intimate or sexual situation , whether it is online or offline. ” Tom says that “ speaking to the TEDWomen audience was an unforgettable and profound experience , and the times since have been equally unforgettable and profound , also educative , at times difficult , and inspiring… ” “ One woman shared with me her truth of being a survivor of rape .
As Thordis says , it ’ s important to get these stories out into the open and to give rape survivors the space to talk about their experiences .
Being open to talking honestly about our global rape culture can be a big step towards changing the dynamics that are perpetuating it .
In the United States alone , RAINN estimates there are over 300,000 victims of rape and sexual assault each year .
Tom noted that “ very few people who have spoken to me about the TED talk haven ’ t , in some way , been personally affected by a man ’ s sexual violence .
Well , today she brings you the perspective of sexuality from the land of another known Queen – England !
At school , sex education started when I was around 13 and was solely focused on heterosexual relations .
It wasn ’ t at all about pleasure , but was focused on ‘ the purpose of sex ’ – having babies .
It also warned about STI ’ s and how to prevent them so that ’ s one good thing , but I don ’ t recall ever being taught about the clitoris , nipples , perineum or any other area that feels pleasurable as those body parts can ’ t contribute to pregnancy .
Gay sex wasn ’ t touched upon at all , we didn ’ t look at different body types , so if your anatomy didn ’ t match the cartoon ones we were shown we would think there was something wrong with us .
And there was certainly no mention of sex being natural , normal , or fun , it was taught as if it was a means to an end .
This led to total confusion and fear when it came to sex .
‘ Dirty magazines , ’ as they were known then ( which is so damaging given then use of the word ‘ dirty ’ to describe sex and nudity ) , were on the top shelf of your local newsagents so ( a ) I couldn ’ t reach them , and ( b ) the newsagent knew my dad .
People didn ’ t sunbathe topless on the beaches and today that still seems to be the case in most parts of the UK .
Whenever I travel abroad , I love to be able to sunbathe topless , providing the country is acceptant of such a thing ( n.b. , Thailand isn ’ t ! ) .
I am perfectly comfortable with my body to strip off and shower , I only get uncomfortable when people stare at me for doing so or seem embarrassed at my nudity .
I love that sex shops are in full view on the high street , right next to mainstream shops .
It teaches society that sex is normal , natural , and that everybody does it .
What impression do we give to our society in Britain when our sex shops aren ’ t able to display their goods in the window , for fear of offending ?
But when you went inside and went up the stairs , they also sold novelty items and sex toys .
Other than that , the only place I ever found to buy sex toys was via a brochure at an Ann Summers party I was lucky enough to be invited to when I was in my twenties .
I used to compare mine to those that belonged to porn stars .
I also learned about sex primarily from porn , which was hardly beneficial when the porn I used to watch was focused on male pleasure , blowjobs , and getting covered in spunk .
What a lot of bad sex and unhelpful thoughts I have had thanks to porn !
I imagine the argument against nudity , sex shops and better , more realistic sex education is that we will be subjecting our children to sex from a young age and therefore encouraging it when we have an age restriction of 16 .
But do we really want to bring our children up to fear sex , to see it as dirty or seedy ?
If I had a choice of my child having happy , consensual , and enjoyable sex at 14 , or having awkward , uncomfortable sex at 16 that they didn ’ t enjoy , I know what I would choose .
And the fact we didn ’ t discuss LGBT sex when I was at school is outrageous .
Hiding LGBT from sex education is extremely damaging and history has proven that .
What would you change about your society ’ s/culture ’ s view on sexuality ?

They talk about struggling with sexual attraction or physical attraction .
They share , often in whispers , the barrage of intrusive thoughts that hammer into psyche waking and sleeping , everything from “ What if I ’ m gay ? ” to “ What if I ’ m a pedophile ? ” When anxiety hits full-steam , it constellates an inner torture chamber where the only escape seems to be to leave .

2Abstinence and celibacy 3Buddhism 4Brahma Kumaris 5.1Desert Fathers 5.2Augustinian view 5.3After Augustine 5.5Celibate homosexual Christians 6Hinduism 7Islam 8Meher Baba 9Ancient Greece and Rome 10The Balkans State of voluntary sexual abstinence This article is about religious sexual abstinence .
Celibacy ( from Latin caelibatus ) is the state of voluntarily being unmarried , sexually abstinent , or both , usually for religious reasons .
[ 1 ] [ 2 ] In a wider sense , it is commonly understood to only mean abstinence from sexual activity .
Sexual abstinence , also known as continence , [ 10 ] is abstaining from some or all aspects of sexual activity , often for some limited period of time , [ 11 ] while celibacy may be defined as a voluntary religious vow not to marry or engage in sexual activity .
[ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Asexuality is commonly conflated with celibacy and sexual abstinence , but it is considered distinct from the two , [ 16 ] [ 17 ] as celibacy and sexual abstinence are behavioral and those who use those terms for themselves are generally motivated by factors such as an individual 's personal or religious beliefs .
[ 18 ] A. W. Richard Sipe , while focusing on the topic of celibacy in Catholicism , states that `` the most commonly assumed definition of celibate is simply an unmarried or single person , and celibacy is perceived as synonymous with sexual abstinence or restraint .
[ 23 ] According to her definition , celibacy ( even short-term celibacy that is pursued for non-religious reasons ) is much more than not having sex .
xxxiii ) states that the discipline of celibacy is to refrain from the use of marriage , i.e .
Augustine of Hippo was one of the first to develop a theory that sexual feelings were sinful and negative .
[ 50 ] Their nature was wounded by concupiscence or libido , which affected human intelligence and will , as well as affections and desires , including sexual desire .
[ citation needed ] The Protestant Reformation rejected celibate life and sexual continence for preachers .
Assuming everyone will marry , they focus their discussion on refraining from premarital sex and focusing on the joys of a future marriage .
Some say the call to be eunuchs for the sake of Heaven in Matthew 19 was a call to be sexually continent and that this developed into celibacy for priests as the successors of the apostles .
Others see the call to be sexually continent in Matthew 19 to be a caution for men who were too readily divorcing and remarrying .
Islam does not promote celibacy ; rather it condemns premarital sex and extramarital sex .
`` [ 80 ] Therefore , religion is clearly not a reason to stay unmarried although people are allowed to live their lives however they are comfortable ; but relationships and sex outside of marriage , let alone forced marriage , is definitely a sin , `` Oh you who believe !
In addition , marriage partners can be distractions from practicing religion at the same time , `` Your mates and children are only a trial for you '' ( Q64:15 ) however that still does not mean Islam does n't encourage people who have sexual desires and are willing to marry .
Promiscuity in sex gratification is bound to land the aspirant in a most pitiful and dangerous chaos of ungovernable lust .
[ 98 ] [ 99 ] `` Pythagoras himself established a small community that set a premium on study , vegetarianism , and sexual restraint or abstinence .
The deliberate abstinence from sexual activity , usually in connection with a religious role or practice .
A voluntary refusal to marry or engage in sexual intercourse , celibacy is often associated with taking religious vows .
`` Sexual intercourse is unnecessary for reproduction because the souls that enter the world during the first half of the Cycle are in possession of a special yogic power ( yog bal ) by which they conceive children '' ^ Barrett , David V ( 2001 ) .
( `` On the Trinity '' ( De Trinitate ) , 5:7 ; CCL 50 , 320 [ 1–12 ] ) ^ Augustine of Hippo , Nisi radicem mali humanus tunc reciperet sensus ( `` Contra Julianum '' , I , 9.42 ; PL 44 , 670 ) ^ In one of Augustine 's late works , Retractationes , he made a significant remark indicating the way he understood difference between spiritual , moral libido and the sexual desire : `` Libido is not good and righteous use of the libido '' ( `` libido non-est bonus et rectus usus libidinis '' ) .

One tax that was considered as a funding source for Obamacare by the Democrats , however , would likely have been far more controversial than all of these put together , and certainly would ’ ve grabbed a lot of headlines : a tax on online porn .
According to longtime Democratic Hill staffer John McDonough , writing in his new book Inside Health Reform , Democratic Sen. Max Baucus and his Senate Finance staff considered numerous sources for other taxes for purposes of funding Obamacare , including elective cosmetic surgery ( a boob job tax ) , a tax on sugary beverages ( Michael Bloomberg would ’ ve loved it ) , as well as sin taxes on alcohol or tobacco sales .
And the porn industry remains a consistent moneymaker ( some estimates conclude it ’ s a $ 12-13 billion industry ) and increasingly makes most of its money via the internet , so taxing it would serve the dual purpose of opening the door for more online taxes .

A new , practical workbook from the New York Times bestselling author of Come As You Are that allows you to apply the book ’ s groundbreaking research and understanding of why and how women ’ s sexuality works to everyday life .
In the twentieth century , women ’ s sexuality was seen as “ Men ’ s Sexuality Lite ” : basically the same , but not quite as good .
From genital response to sexual desire to orgasm , we just couldn ’ t understand that complicated , inconsistent , crazy-making “ lady business. ” That is , until Dr. Emily Nagoski changed the game with her New York Times bestseller , Come As You Are .
Using groundbreaking science and research , she proved that the most important factor in creating and sustaining a sex life filled with confidence and joy is not what the parts are or how they ’ re organized , but how you feel about them .
Which means that things like stress , mood , trust , and body image are not peripheral factors in a woman ’ s sexual wellbeing ; they are central to it .
And , that even if you don ’ t yet feel that way , you are already sexually whole .
Nagoski ’ s book changed countless women ’ s lives and approaches to sex , and now she offers the next step .

More than 1,000 others followed , leading to 2,100 individual reports of abuse and rape by the doctor .
The university had been in mediation to resolve multiple lawsuits by Stone and others , primarily men , who said the doctor sexually abused them during routine medical examinations .
Fifty years later , I ’ m still carrying this anger. ” The agreement is one of the largest by an American university to settle sexual abuse allegations .
In May 2021 , a law firm hired by the university concluded that the doctor had “ engaged in sexual misconduct with patients on countless occasions. ” “ We hope this settlement will begin the healing process for survivors , ” said Jordan Acker , chair of the University of Michigan Board of Regents , in a prepared statement .

The event you describe , receipt of unprotected oral sex , is a virtually no risk event .
While there are one or two cases reported which may have been acquired through performance of oral sex on an infected partner , I am not aware of any credible reports of a person acquiring HIV from receipt of oral sex .
Thus , while West Africa does have relatively high rates of HIV , most commercial sex workers still do not have HIV and even if your partner did , there is no meaningful risk for HIV from the exposure you describe .
Are the HIV strains here different than in the US that could facilitate transmission through oral sex ?
At this time , 3.5 weeks after your exposure and with no symptoms , there is no medical reason to test for other STIs which might have been acquired through receipt of oral sex .
As for HIV , receipt of oral sex is just not a very `` efficient '' means of acquiring STIs .
There are no known strain differences which might change the risk for transmission by oral sex .
There are no known cases in which someone has gotten HIV through receipt of oral sex .
If I test negative , is it ok to resume sexual relations with my partner ?

It is based on the life of a noblewoman born in 1643 , who married a bastard son of King Frederik III , divorced him for a social and financial inferior , was caught in flagrante delicto with a stableboy , and spent the later years of her long life in poverty and degradation .

Marie Grubbe is an astonishingly modern study of a woman driven and undone by her sexuality .

Concord and Waltham Offices – Accepting New Patients Dr. Cheryl Gray graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard University in 1999 .
( Photo by Charles Sykes/Invision/AP ) < /p > Late night TV is taking heat from social media and news outlets for its failure thus far to address the sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein that came to light in a New York Times story published last Thursday .
The New York Times ' story detailed multiple incidents of alleged sexual harassment against Weinstein , who was fired from his own production company on Sunday .
Headlines like `` Late-Night Hosts Ignore Harvey Weinstein Sexual Harassment Scandal '' ran on conservative sites like Breitbart , while other outlets ran op-eds that slammed late night for being `` hypocrites , '' citing references to late night jokes about Bill O'Reilly when he faced accusations of sexual harassment .
All I could think was , “ How disrespectful can you fucking be to play HER music during a night dedicated to Kurt ? ” Then I really sat and thought about it , and it really fit the night .
I was shocked and appalled , but when I thought about it , how much more fucking punk rock and rebellious can you get ?
As far as the performance goes , Campbell and Dee kick ass , showing why they are some of the absolute best musicians out there when it comes to what they do ( in recent months I even saw Dee filling in behind the kit at a Scorpions gig , which goes to show that there is no limit to what this guy can do ) .
But with all the subway cases that are happening where people die , where they get robbed , or where people try to abuse women sexually are causing panic in our city residents .
The basic differences between the biological sexes means that there must necessarily be differences between couples of different sexes and couples of the same sex .
It is normal for two people of the opposite sex to be able to have a baby .
Two people of the same sex , in contrast , can never have a baby .
This is because reproductive acts require a man and a woman , which necessarily precludes by definition two people of the same sex .
This double standard and discrimination based on sexual orientation is actually championed by the LGBTQ zealots : “ California law SB-1172 Sexual orientation change efforts actually does intentionally and specifically discriminate against people based solely on their sexual orientation .
The bill states : ‘ The task force [ Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation by the American Psychological Association ] concluded that sexual orientation change efforts can pose critical health risks to lesbian , gay , and bisexual people… ’ which includes a long list of every known negative emotion a human can experience including suicidal thoughts .

This is the starting point for domination and terror , and thus for the many manifestations of institutionalized violence based on the spread of fear .
It is the fear of diminishing power and the pathological clinging to a past anchored in the androcratic domination model , coupled with a global male playground of competition for hegemonic mental and physical territory , hence pathological power that lies at the source of this war .
The fear of losing power is therefore an important building block in the pathologization of power into violence and domination .

In order to keep the peace , the LAPD brass knows they need to make an arrest right away , so they grab recently-fired black cop Todd Roark and haul him off to jail , even though he looks nothing like the rapist and is half the guy ’ s size .
The institutionally racist LAPD tells Roark he ’ s facing the death penalty—not for rape , but for kidnapping .
Galindo vows he will catch the real rapist and get his friend out of jail .
Galindo 's plan is to convene a task force and have the costume and makeup departments from Universal Studios help put real life cops in drag as decoys in order to catch the rapist when he strikes again .
After an agonizing night of sitting in their Chevys , Studebakers and Plymouths , the task force hits paydirt—the rapist picks on the lone female cop among the decoys , who happens to be in a car with Galindo .
A physically and mentally exhausting three hour car and foot chase and gun battle begins—three times the rapist aims his Luger point-blank at Galindo and pulls the trigger…and each time it misfires .
Finally , the rapist is shot and caught by another undercover team , a little boy recovers the discarded Luger , and Galindo makes sure that Roark is cleared of all charges .

The interest in this election was sparked by allegations from eight women who have accused Moore of sexually preying on them when they were teenagers and when he was in his 30s .

This is why historically marriage isn ’ t consummated until sexual union takes place , as the fusing together of their energy fields .
When we engage in the sexual act , we enter into rapport with the person while experiencing a heightened sense of love as physical pleasure , which is the actual experience of blending energetically .
The actual orgasm , or peak experience , is full infusion where all resistance subsides and fusion takes place as a loss of self-awareness .
But when we engage in the sexual act with people we don ’ t or barely know , those of poor moral character who possess behavioral dynamics we don ’ t want to be apart of , or who have fused unconsciously with many others of the same values and moral character , we corrupt ourselves with a dynamic matrix of unknown properties .
This is why many spiritual traditions abstain from sexual union , and instead encourage a loving union with God – as our higher Self , is to keep the soul pure and unadulterated .
Through intimacy and sexual intercourse that leads to an orgasm as the complete surrender of our ability to contain ourselves , we explode , let go , and fully merge into the spiritual energy of the other person and a permanent fusion takes place that alters our consciousness forever .

`` This is a very kinky party .
Please undress completely , leaving only your panties , and if you need to go to the bathroom , now is the time .
The other girl was very well endowed , so her tits literally dangled out of the corset , and this was more evident as the assistant tightened the thing .
Her cover was the model for hire , and it was supposed that she knew what the suits were , so whatever the distress , she had to suck it up and go on .
The object was a dick shaped pole that they pushed inside the other girl ’ s pussy after taking off her panties .
The assistant pushed her feet into something and as she slid it up , it became apparent that it was a pair of panties with a hole to manage the pole .
The assistants were strong and she was in no shape to confront them , so she committed to stand still as she felt a couple of fingers opening her snatch .
On top of that , the dildo they shoved into her was bothering more than she had imagined .
The real shocker was when she put her hands on the pole connected to the dildo and tried to budge it down .
Sidney could feel the rigid cock moving into her , and took stock of the pain and pleasure that this movement caused her .
Sidney and her colleague were in no position to resist , every pull on the chain meant sharp pain in their pussy , so they had no choice .
Moreover , she discovered that when she allowed herself to take normal steps this made the chain tight , pushing down the pole , just to be recalled in position by the straps linking the dildo to the corset .
And this could be a problem , since the whole thing sent a tingling on her sex .
She believed that it would be fairly safe to say that no one could recognise her , with all these things , yet she would move around people with a cock pumping in her pussy .
The man pushing her , reached for her right breast and took the nipple between his finger and started to pinch it .
The pain was sharp and the sudden understanding that she had no power there , made her pussy wet almost immediately .
Every book she had written sucks me in right from the beginning and ROOMHATE is no different .

Sextimacy is the effort to build emotional closeness through sex .
As nowadays people more than ever feel free to act the way they want to , especially when it comes to love , it can be easy to mix sexual contacts with emotional intimacy .
Here is the experience of the New York-based sexologist Shelby Sells : “ This is not the sex they taught in 8th grade !
The sex .
Oh , the sex was fantastic .
Though we developed sexual intimacy , neither of our emotional needs were being met .
We did , however , carry on a sexual relationship that went on for some time after that. ” So , the conclusion we could draw from this story is that if you are hoping for a sexual connection to finally transform itself into a committed relationship , you should stop !
Different research proves that relationships which are based on sex without emotional intimacy present usually stay at this physical level .
And people across the political spectrum agree that it ’ s kind of , we ’ re losing it because screens are sucking our attention and we don ’ t realize that we ’ re having to go over value to the screen instead of using the screen to support us , to meet the goals that we ’ re setting for ourselves , which is a true digital native , I think would be using the screen to generate a value rather than letting it suck value from their life .

NR : I was reading a review of the book The Sex Lives of African Women [ by Nana Darkoa Sekyiamah ] and thought of you because of how you talk about the attitudes on sex and sexuality in your family , attitudes that are so much more open than in my vaguely left-wing family for instance and because how you talk about Africa feels like a parallel culture and parallel world that white people in North America do not know about at all .

IB : I don ’ t know if it ’ s a soliloquy but it ’ s a story that my mom and I talk about a lot because it ’ s the first time that she realized this kid is fucking weird .

part of this diatribe merely stems from the fact that I may have finally lost the love of my life , and being as how she was my only muse , I don ’ t know what the fuck to do .

This is from their press release : Every Friday and Saturday night , we ’ re flooded with requests from straight girls in penis hats who want to ogle our go-gos , dance with the gays and celebrate their pending nuptials .
A group of Biola University students made themselves known a few weeks ago by creating a web site , asking “ to be treated with equality and respected as another facet of Biola ’ s diversity. ” That web site drew a lengthy response ( PDF : 172KB/4 pages ) , reminding everyone that “ all members of the University community are expected to following the teachings of scripture ” before reiterating Biola ’ s position regarding “ any act of sexual intimacy between two persons of the same sex , as illegitimate moral options for the confessing Christian. ” MSNBC has followed up on the group which “ has shaken this 104-year-old Christian college ” : Chris Grace , vice president for student development at Biola , said the school would like to engage in conversation with the underground group but has been stymied by the members ’ anonymity .
Eventually , Members of the group would like to “ come out ” and be open about their sexuality .

They have the common viverrid characteristics of pouches for scent-marking ( the perineal gland , located between the genitals and anus ) , and an odd fold on the outside rim of the ear which forms a sort of purse .
Their penis bones , ingested as a powder or cooked into food , are said to help men stay virile and to help produce male children .
They do strongly resemble the male ’ s anatomy , including a “ false penis , ” an impression created in part by the presence of a clitoral bone .
I have seen bints engaging in sexual activities in a remarkable variety of positions , and regardless of whether or not they have a human audience .

And when the screen went completely blank , as there is a nonvocal interlude in the Sinatra version that is n't in the Smith version and for which I was n't prepared , I appealed to the audience for advice ... they yelled `` DANCE , '' and so I shimmied my feather boa and shook my cotton titties and kicked my exquisite new strappy pumps as high as I could , with abandon and gusto .
Between going off key every three bars and the impromptu cooch-dance , I essentially made a total ass of myself , but the crowd loved it , and it was so liberating .
And then there was the moment in the finale number of the second and final performance in which I suddenly realized , as I hit my notes and flailed my arms as instructed , that I was doing it right and I was fabulous ... `` here I am singing in front of people and I do n't suck ! ''
I hope your day is super ... and that if you make an ass of yourself , you 'll enjoy it .

The only places on the Vegas strip that consistently featured 60 ’ s-70 ’ s rock and soul ( live or through the sound system ) were Mandalay Bay and Margaritaville ; the rest had all gone hip-hop , a genre I find as boring as a bad fuck .
Billy Idol ’ s music lies somewhere on the fringes of my dancing tastes ; there are some songs that immediately propel my ass out of the seat and some songs that reek too much of disco glitz for me to bother .
I ’ m not inviting anyone else to participate b ) I don ’ t own a chalkboard and d. ) This is my fucking blog and what I say goes !
One more note before I literally get my ass in gear .
I don ’ t think it was that bad , but it sure as fuck wasn ’ t Radiohead .
Let ’ s just say that all rock ‘ n ’ roll is about disenfranchisement , the existential angst attached to a meaningless bourgeois existence , sex , sex , sex and move the fuck on .
The mythical version of the story ends with “ and it became Billy ’ s first hit in America , ” an assertion that depends entirely on how you define “ hit. ” I would argue that making # 27 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart might qualify as a “ squeaker , ” but hardly a “ hit. ” Still , the song does kick ass , and it has many of the ingredients you ’ ll find in any great dance song .
One : a clarion call to get your ass out of your seat ( the strong introductory beat and assertive opening guitar riff ) —a passage just long enough to take one last swig of your favorite cocktail and lead your honey to the dance floor .
Now we have the start of a strong build , and after a while , you can ’ t wait for the band to fucking let it rip .
The phrase “ mony mony ” is euphonious and echoes the word “ moaning , ” reminding listeners of the thrill of an orgasm .
The song opens with the bass-driven stop time we heard in “ Dancing in the Streets , ” but here it ’ s repeated later in the song , indicating that Billy believed he ’ d found a winning formula , a “ signature sound. ” That in itself makes the song less appealing to me , but when you ’ re in the heat of the dance moment , you really don ’ t give a shit about rock star marketization .
Oh , well , I can only work with what I ’ ve got—oh , bullshit .
Here we have the hot-summer-night theme where the young and horny descend on a city to celebrate the fact that they ’ re young and horny and have descended on the city .
You made a whole world just by getting drunk and fucking ?
You people really are far fucking out !
New York ! ” with “ Kansas City ! ” or “ Billings ! ” or “ Dogtown , Alabama ! ” or “ Chicken , Alaska ! ” The latter city fits the theme very well with their welcoming sign , “ I Got Laid in Chicken , Alaska. ” According to Billy ’ s bio , if he wasn ’ t doing drugs or on the stage or in the studio , he was fucking .
No shit .
So , turn off your language processing center , focus on Phil Feit ’ s seriously hot bass guitar and let your legs and ass do the rest .
Quick story line : horny babe shows up at Billy ’ s pad , says “ Fuck me ! ” and then they fuck .
But it gets better—it turns out she ’ s a hold-nothing-back screamer , which may lead to some problems with Billy ’ s neighbors , but believe me , if you ’ re the one inspiring those screams , you couldn ’ t give a flying fuck about the neighbors .
The second time you think , “ Hey , I must be pretty good in the sack to inspire such passion ! ” When the third time comes around , it finally dawns on you that your performance has nothing to do with it—the scream is just the broad ’ s “ sexual brand. ” End the relationship immediately .
I can ’ t scream because then you ’ ll all think I ’ m a fake screamer and no one will ever fuck me again !
The only words in this song you need to pay attention to in this song are “ flesh , ” “ fantasy , ” and “ it ’ s after midnight. ” Put it all together and you should be able to grasp the “ meaning. ” This one sounds like a knock-off of a David Bowie disco-era song , and it seriously sucks .
And what the fuck is this ?
“ Cradle of Love ” : Billy ’ s only # 1 mainstream rock hit in the U. S. is a slickly-produced dance-rock number about robbing the cradle , the act of fucking and sometimes marrying an underage girl .
To put it mildly , I hate this fucking song , and looking back at this juncture in modern music history , Nirvana couldn ’ t have entered the scene soon enough .
Oh , no—I don ’ t want you to lose the danceability factor , but let me give you something to think about : sex isn ’ t all about titillation , and it ’ s a lot more satisfying when you engage body , brain and good ol ’ fashioned human emotion .

In fact , a report by the School of Texas shows that three out of five girls had been aware that the online date was already involved in sexual activity before that they met personally .
This means that they could become more likely to exchange pictures , take part in physical contact , and get sexually explicit content .

The U.S. Department of Education has finalized a rule that will put students at greater risk of sexual harassment & assault .
Osub Ahmed , Senior Policy Analyst for Women ’ s Health & Rights with the Center for American Progress ’ Women ’ s Initiative stated , “ The rule does a grave injustice to survivors of sexual harassment & assault by forcing them to satisfy unreasonably stringent standards when trying to pursue their cases & making it easier for schools to ignore complaints altogether .
By raising reporting thresholds & changing grievance procedures , schools will likely investigate fewer incidents of sexual harassment—an impact that the Education Department even acknowledges in its rules—which will have a chilling effect on reporting of sexual harassment & roll back the clock on efforts to ensure gender equity in schools .
We know that 1 in 5 women report experiencing some form of sexual assault during their time in college & survivors have relied on the protections afforded by Title IX to safely report these incidents for decades .
CAP research has found that allegations of harassment appeared more frequently in Title IX complaints based on LGBTQ identity than in the general population , with nearly 76 percent of such complaints alleging sexual or gender harassment .
Once again , this just goes to show that Second Life is more than just socialization and virtual sex .
“ We are committed to the development of a just and caring democratic society in which schools serve as centers of inquiry and forces for social transformation that foster social , economic , and educational equity by honoring differences in race , class , gender , ethnicity , and sexual preference. ” Schalin also provides several examples of how other instructors have injected their own unique biases into the course , generally through assignments and required readings .

In addition to a very restrictive political and civil sphere , sexual harassment has become even more pervasive .
According to a survey released by UN Women , a staggering 99 % of women in Egypt have suffered sexually harassment .
To his credit , el Sisi has acknowledged the increasing levels of sexual violence against women , which is something no former president has ever acknowledged .
The government has introduced stiff penalties for the perpetrators of sexual harassment : any verbal , physical , behavioral or online form of sexual harassment is punishable by six months to five years in prison and a fine up to 50,000 L.E ( $ 6250 ) .
In 1971 , as a response to the popularity of sexual guidebooks such as The Sensuous Woman ( by `` J '' ) and The Sensuous Man ( by `` M '' ) , Asimov published The Sensuous Dirty Old Man under the byline `` Dr. ' A ' '' [ 181 ] ( although his full name was printed on the paperback edition , first published 1972 ) .
However , by 2016 , some of Asimov 's behavior towards women was described as sexual harassment and cited as an example of historically problematic behavior by men in science fiction communities .

Burlesque houses , such as The Gayety , promoted more risqué acts in the effort to give the public something that they couldn ’ t get in movies , especially after the adoption of the Hayes production code in 1932 , which not only banned nudity but placed Draconian restrictions on sexual content and references in film .
If you are sexually active and this doesn ’ t mean that you are taking part in penetrative sex , you still run the risk of catching some kind of sexually transmitted infection .
It ’ s only when sexually transmitted infections are not diagnosed that they will cause problems later on in life and this includes being able to create a little baby of your own .
Many people don ’ t seem to realise but many sexually transmitted infections do not show up any symptoms at all and so the only way that you ’ re going to know that you have one or more is to make a visit to your sexual health clinic in Sydney .
It encourages honesty – If you want to be known as a sexually responsible person then it makes perfect sense that you would want to get yourself checked at your local sexual health clinic at least once or twice a year or after any risky sexual encounter .
Everyone needs to be able to make an informed decision about their sexual health and the only way that you can do that effectively is to get yourself checked .
You can not receive effective treatment if you have not been diagnosed in the first place for sexually transmitted infections .

Queen Elizabeth II Responds To Prince Andrew ’ s Sexual Assault Case Prince Andrew is set to face civil court in New York this year Overnight Queen Elizabeth II stripped Prince Andrew of his royal and military titles after a New York judge ruled to prevent the Royal ’ s lawyers from blocking a sexual assault lawsuit on Wednesday .
Photo by Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images ) The 61-year-old is being sued by Virginia Giuffre for sexual assault while she was under the age of 18 .
Within the lawsuit she alleges that Jeffrey Epstein , Ghislaine Maxwell and Prince Andrew forced her to engage in sexual activity with the Queen ’ s second son .
Buckingham Palace initially refused to comment on the court proceedings , telling The Independent , “ We would not comment on what is an ongoing legal matter. ’ ’ It comes after close friend and accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty on five counts of aiding Epstein in the trafficking of teenage girls for sexual abuse between 1994 and 2004 , in late December .

Day 1 : Despite stall tactics by the defense , Sepur Zarco case opens in Guatemalan courts The first case in the world to be tried in a domestic court for sexual and domestic slavery opened in Guatemala City today , for crimes against humanity committed at the Sepur Zarco military base in the early 1980s .
At the national level , this is the first time a court in Guatemala is considering a case of sexual violence to be considered a crime against humanity .
Fifteen women from the eastern community of Sepur Zarco gave preliminary testimonies in 2012 to having been forced to take shifts at the military base as sexual slaves in 1982 and forced to cook for the soldiers and clean their clothes .
This case has become emblematic for its recognition of sexual violence as a systematic tool used by the Guatemalan military during the internal armed conflict and represents a significant global moment for the prosecution of sexual violence and other gender-based crimes .
Former Coronel Esteelmer Francisco Reyes Girón and former Military Commissioner Heriberto Valdez Asig were arrested in June 2014 and are facing charges of crimes against humanity , including sexual violence and sexual and domestic slavery .
In a press conference on Sunday , former UNAMG director Maya Alvarado said , “ This is one of the few cases that recognize sexual violence as a crime with international transcendence…We expect the Guatemalan State and society to carry out justice in this case and the many more cases that remain in silence .
Apparently , conventional wisdom suggests there is a single reaction after sexual abuse : trauma .
It seems that laymen and Clancy ’ s colleagues would do well to focus on those subjects , however many or few of them , who had not reported these sexual assaults , regardless of whether Clancy is correct or not .
The reviewer noted that the main point in The Trauma Myth is that sex crimes are underreported , and possibly due to children being confused by the fact that they had not felt traumatized ( and thus somehow thought that they were not victims ) .
Such variables as age , sex , income , education , marital status , and mobility can all have significant influence on consumer behavior .
We suck , we have no 10 , and the team is floundering .
The present time is no exception where specific issues like race and sexual identity are front and center .
They desire to remain steadfast to the divine revelation of God regarding human depravity , that all , regardless of race or sexual identities , “ …have fallen short of the glory of God. ” And further , that God created male and female and instituted marriage by which they would express sexual relationships .
Many Christians come to Christ with a background of other sexually related sins , fornication , adultery , pornography , etc .
Lay Elders , An Important Book for You , As Defenders of Truth The sources to which “ gay Christians ” constantly appeal—secular psychology , sociological data , identity theory , and the personal experiences of people who identify as sexual minorities—are not sufficient to guide us into all truth…If the Bible is God ’ s holy , inerrant , and clear revelation , then it is the foundation of all that we should believe and do—regardless of anyone ’ s contrary personal experience .
It ’ s not only related to sexual morality .
Much emphasis is directed on loving the sinner , making the sinner comfortable , welcoming the sinner in our churches and times of worship that the inordinate heinousness of certain dishonorable , indecent , shameful sexual desires , lusts , passions , and sexual acts are softened or ignored .
We mustn ’ t get the cart before the horse. ” Now to some of the author ’ s revealing facts : The sources to which “ gay Christians ” constantly appeal—secular psychology , sociological data , identity theory , and the personal experiences of people who identify as sexual minorities—are not sufficient to guide us into all truth .
and the connection of sexual lust and rejecting God ( “ God gave them up ” ) .
Most books dealing with such controversial issues such as homosexuality or any sexual sin may not be totally flawed .
Yet their aim and emphases have serious influence and ramifications in diluting biblical truth by either softening the exceeding sinfulness of sexual sins or ignoring the universality of total depravity that affects all people , not only those with homosexual desires .
No , immoral sexual desires afflict heterosexuals , pedophiles , and more .
Universal depravity in the area of sexuality implies in Scripture that regardless of the direction such desires , temptations , or urges take , God ’ s Word and the work of the Holy Spirit would be the same for all .
Nonetheless , when it comes to the issue of same-sex sexual desires or actions , we can not escape the fact there is nothing in Scripture that even hints at sympathy for either .
The same can be said for heterosexual adultery , fornication , or addiction to pornography .
Throughout God ’ s divine revelation and Church history , sin—and particularly sexual sin—is/was treated as egregious .
Additionally , nowhere in God ’ s divine revelation do we find any positive reference to identifying ourselves or our personhood with sin , sexual or otherwise , especially not as Christians , disciples of Jesus Christ .
Any and all sexual sins must be fled .
It ’ s the same with many other sins unrelated to human sexuality .
That doesn ’ t preclude or dismiss their sinful propensities , temptations , or urges to sexual immorality .
Personal Thoughts as June 2022 Closes : A Lamentation To begin with the month of June was marked by a month-long celebration of two deadly sins , according to God ’ s divine revelation : pride and sexual immorality .

To begin with the month of June was marked by a month-long celebration of two deadly sins , according to God ’ s divine revelation : pride and sexual immorality .
Such flags celebrate and flaunt diverse sexual acts and relationships God has clearly communicated to be evil .
All month long , the media forced us to be witnesses to such open and unabashed flaunting of a sinful nature and practices he named as “ shameful , indecent , abominable , detestable , unnatural. ” To be proud of a sinful sexual orientation or acts has to be unimaginable to say the least .
Just think , no one boasts of pride in a natural sexual orientation or acts .
In fact , we may have exceeded them in sacrificing innocent human beings and flaunting sexual immoralities .
The brutality of the operation , which allegedly involved residents being tied up and otherwise mistreated , shocked Serbia… ” [ 12 ] In short other words , in order to keep onto one ’ s ill-gotten gains and stay at the top in Serbia , while keeping this sort of story out of ‘ mainstream ’ news , there is an unwritten EU demand of ‘ play ball our way or we will show you the door to some very unpleasant consequence. ’ Organized crime ‘ playing for keeps ’ , whether it is the ‘ transcendent corruption ’ ( legalized ) organized crime of the European Union , or the more local mob scene , is certainly nothing new when it comes exploiting geopolitical blackmail potential in Serbia , here ’ s a short profile of Serbia ’ s Health Minister : “ According to the 2004 testimony of the cooperative witness Dejan Milenković Bagzi ( who was an important member of the Zemun Clan ) in the Zoran Đinđić trial , in Serbian Special Court for Organised Crime : on 5 September 2002 , Belgrade-based Rakovica Clan tried to eliminate the Montenegrin criminal Veselin Božović Vesko , but he survived the assassination and was transferred to the Clinical Centre of Serbia in which at that time worked Lončar .

“ Hate That You Know Me So Well ” featuring Carly Rae Jepsen ( who he reveals on Twitter as “ the first before anyone gave a shit about me ” ) , is the perfect pop song to showcase how he has forged new relationships since his sister ’ s death .

Heterosexuals , homosexuals , and bisexuals are all so shallow , because they value physical appearance and genitals over other characteristics .
If you specifically want a partner with the intellect of a bag of dildos , you ’ re probably an abusive , manipulative asshole .
But by calling yourself “ sapiosexual , ” you ’ re suggesting that attractiveness to intelligence is your sexuality .
That means that in theory you should be able to masturbate to a person of indeterminate gender recounting their winning chess moves , or whatever your idea of “ intelligence ” is .
All of that is to say that I was very skeptical when I saw a paper published in a journal called , fittingly , “ Intelligence , ” titled “ Some people are attracted sexually to intelligence : A psychometric evaluation of sapiosexuality. ” I was interested , though , because while I was sure that most people calling themselves “ sapiosexual ” on social media are in fact just trying to look smarter and deeper than they are , I accept that an actual “ sapiosexual ” could exist — i.e. , one who becomes sexually aroused first and foremost by the presumed intelligence of another person , regardless of ( or eclipsing ) that person ’ s other physical or psychological characteristics .
As a sapiosexual , I was not at all sexually aroused by it .
It tells us nothing , except that people want to believe that they value intelligence over all other factors when it comes to sexual attraction .
Today we ’ re going to end this series by talking about sexuality .
We live , like I said , in a cultural moment where things are changing in regards to sexuality quicker than they have ever changed .
My goal , this morning , is not to give an entire discourse on sexuality or a complete diagnostic of our cultural moment , that would be fun and interesting , but it would take hours and hours and hours .
I ’ m not going to talk about the politics behind the sexual revolution of the 1960 ’ s and where that ’ s left us .
I ’ m not going to talk a lot about the debate between gender and sexuality .
What I want to talk about this morning is how do we as a church wrestle with this issue of sexuality , specifically homosexuality and the LGBTQ community as a whole .
In order to talk about sexuality , we have to start at the very beginning of the story .
Do not be deceived : neither the sexually immoral , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor men who practice homosexuality , nor thieves , nor the greedy , nor drunkards , nor revilers , nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God .
Notice that homosexuality and sexual impurity are in a category with a number of things , but it ’ s there .
If you ’ ve ever felt ashamed of your body ; if you ’ ve ever had an affair ; if you ’ ve ever looked at a person in lust ; if you ’ ve ever looked at pornography ; if you ’ ve thought you don ’ t measure up sexually ; if you ’ ve kept a secret from your spouse ; if you ’ ve failed to enter into a relationship because of fear ; if you ’ ve taken advantage of another person ; if you haven ’ t allowed yourself to be fully known by your spouse ; if any of those things apply to you , your sexuality is broken .

1 Corinthians 5:1-2 — It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you , and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans , for a man has his father ’ s wife .
We need to be concerned with our sexuality and tackle that one first .
The Scriptures are really , really clear in condemning sexual immorality—or what we might call promiscuity or what we might call sex outside of the bonds of marriage .
3 ) The husbands were sexually faithful to their wife .
Christians adamantly rejected sexual promiscuity and it was one of their primary , MAIN platforms as a church .
But please notice , if you go back and flip one chapter back to 1 Corinthians 4 , all the other things that Paul condemned along with sexual immorality and homosexuality .
All in the same category as this issue of sexuality .

And now this.A commentary at the Rorate Caeli blog site said what had to be said for the sake of truth : “ There ’ s no other way to put it : The pope ’ s Apostolic Exhortation Amoris laetitia is a catastrophe. ” Voice of the Family likewise recognized what was immediately apparent from a reading of the critical Chapter 8 : “ Our initial overview provides sufficient cause to regard this document as a threat to the integrity of the Catholic faith and the authentic good of the family. ” Even normally middle-of-the-road commentators have not concealed their alarm over the document ’ s patent downgrading of Our Lord ’ s demanding teaching in the realm of sexual morality and Francis ’ s thematic argument that “ mitigating factors ” and “ concrete situations ” somehow convert mortally sinful adultery and fornication into mere “ irregularities ” falling short of the “ ideal ” of Christian marriage but nonetheless possessing “ constructive elements. ” See extended discussion at II .
Catholic World Report , published by Father Joseph Fessio , S.J. , presented a symposium of articles on the document , nearly all of them strongly critical in some respect , particularly concerning Chapter 8 , the focus of this commentary : · Father Fessio ’ s fellow Jesuit , James V. Schall , S.J. , agreed that the overall document has a subversive impact respecting the Church ’ s teaching on sexual immorality and grave sin in general : “ But when we add it all up , it often seems that the effect of this approach is to lead us to conclude that no “ sin ” has ever occurred .
The Synod was merely the delivery vehicle for Amoris Laetitia , wherein Francis , as I will demonstrate below , finally arrives at the destination he has arranged from the beginning : admission of “ certain ” ( ultimately all ) divorced and “ remarried ” Catholics , along with other habitual public sinners of the sexual variety , to Confession and Holy Communion without prior repentance and amendment of life .
Exceeding even the most pessimistic predictions , Francis goes beyond his sham of a Synod to proclaim what amounts to a de facto ecclesial “ amnesty ” on grave sexual immorality generally , if that were possible .
( 1 ) “ Moral ecumenism ” and praise of “ irregular ” sexual relationships ; Christian marriage reduced to an ideal ( 291-294 ) .
According to this repellant novelty , the Church is now supposed to recognize the “ constructive elements ” in relationships she has traditionally condemned as mortally sinful , including second “ marriages ” and “ even simple cohabitation , ” so long as they tick enough boxes on a new checklist of “ constructive features ” that supposedly confer nobility on illicit sexual unions : “ stability , ” “ deep affection , ” “ responsibility for offspring ” and “ an ability to overcome trials in the midst of a storm. ” ( 293 ) Just as “ ecumenism ” harps incessantly on the “ good elements ” in false religions laden with heresy and superstition , leaving their practitioners undisturbed in their errors , the newly invented moral ecumenism of the Synod of Francis will now harp incessantly on the good elements in false relationships involving adultery and fornication , leaving their participants undisturbed in sin .
Accordingly , also in line with ecumenism , Amoris Laetitia now informs us that “ Christian marriage , as a reflection of the union between Christ and his Church , is fully realized in the union between a man and a woman who give themselves to each other in a free , faithful and exclusive love , who belong to each other until death and are open to the transmission of life , and are consecrated by the sacrament… ” ( 292 ) The reader will readily guess what is coming next : “ Some forms of union radically contradict this ideal , while others realize it in at least a partial and analogous way. ” So , Christian marriage now becomes the “ fullness ” of marriage , while illicit sexual unions of various kinds are seriously described as “ partially ” realizing this “ ideal. ” In like manner , the Catholic Church is “ ecumenically ” described as merely possessing the “ fullness of truth ” while other religions have a more or less acceptable quantum of it .
( 294 ) According to Francis , “ de facto unions ” are now to be viewed as “ opportunities that can lead to the full reality of marriage and family in conformity with the Gospel. ” ( 294 ) Thus people living in sin are now said to have “ part ” of the reality of marriage—a proposition as nonsensical as the claim that heretics who reject the very existence of the Catholic Church and practice various forms of gravely sinful sexual immorality are somehow in “ partial communion ” with her .
Mortally sinful sexual unions are no longer to be treated as threats to salvation , but only as stages in a “ gradual ” moral development .
( 2 ) “ Integrating weakness ” of those in immoral sexual unions ; objective conduct and consequent scandal and profanation of the Eucharist ignored ( 295-299 ) .
The complete sentence reads : “ This means , in practice , that when , for serious reasons , such as for example the children ’ s upbringing , a man and a woman can not satisfy the obligation to separate , they “ take on themselves the duty to live in complete continence , that is , by abstinence from the acts proper to married couples. ” What does Francis have to say about John Paul II ’ s teaching , also the constant teaching of the Church , that divorced and civilly remarried couples who can not separate because of children must live in complete continence and abstain from all further adulterous sexual relations ?
But that principle of moral theology applies to individual sinful acts such as masturbation ( §2352 ) , not a continuing state of public immorality and consequent scandal without repentance or any firm purpose of amendment .
Even Nicole Winfield of the Associated Press is constrained to note that in Amoris Laetitia Francis is “ selectively citing his predecessors ” so as to navigate around key phrases that negate his position : While Francis frequently cited John Paul , whose papacy was characterized by a hardline insistence on doctrine and sexual morals , he did so selectively .
( 6 ) The Poison Pill Footnote ; admission of public adulterers and other habitual sexual sinners to the sacraments ( 305-312 ) ; the Pope confirms .
As we shall see below , however , Francis apparently thinks he can limit his veritable ecclesial amnesty on mortal sin to sins of a sexual variety , making this “ apostolic exhortation ” an even more bizarre development .
Is it just sexuality ?
The very hallmark of heretical German moral theology , exemplified by Francis ’ s personal favorite , Cardinal Kasper , amounts to a de facto amnesty on sexual immorality .
BUT NOTE WELL : Nothing in Amoris Laetitia indicates that Francis would extend his amnesty for sexual sinners to the other sorts of sinners he never ceases to denounce , including Mafiosi , arms traders , greedy capitalists , polluters of the environment , opponents of uncontrolled immigration , supporters of the death penalty and , lest we forget , the “ rigorist ” Catholics who oppose his notion of “ mercy. ” Would Francis , for example , tell the pastors of the Church that because of “ various cognitive or psychological conditions ” that make it “ very difficult to act differently ” greedy billionaires , wealthy arms dealers or “ rigorist ” Catholics are subjectively guiltless and can not be expected to change their ways in conformity to “ the ideal ” ?

The prevalence rate of urinary tract infection , age distribution and influence of sex were determined .
The anatomical relationship of the female urethra to the vagina makes it liable to trauma during sexual intercourse ; the moist environment of the females perineum favors microbial growth and predisposes females to bladder contamination [ 10 ] [ 11 ] .
That Staphylococcus aureus is implicated in UTI in many sexually active females , as reported by [ 28 ] [ 39 ] is in agreement with the findings in the present study .
They attributed the higher incidence rate of urinary tract infection in female to the nature of the anatomical structure of their urinogenital tract ; the urethra of females is much shorter and closer to the anus than in males , and it also lacks the bacteriostatic properties of prostatic secretions .
Therefore , the higher incidence in females observed in this work , may be as a result of the unhygienic habits of not cleaning the vagina from front to the back after urination but rather from back to front , thus resulting in autoinfection .
This may be as a result of increased sexual activity within this age group which predisposes them to UTI .
This view is supported by the work of [ 54 ] , who reported that sex is the cause of 75 % - 90 % of bladder infections , and that the risk of infection is invariably related to the frequency of sex .
[ 2 ] Among women , breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and also accounts for the highest cancer related mortality for this sex group .

Tag : reading the Song of Songs Why I read the Song of Songs V Auguste Rodin ( 1840–1917 ) , ‘ Kissers ’ Many of us will have come across statistics like : the average man thinks about sex every seven seconds .
My fifth reason for reading the Song of Songs is that it makes me think about sex all day .
It seems ludicrous to me , and yet I do believe that there is nothing wrong with thinking about sex all day .
In fact , given Christianity ’ s tarnished reputation in this area , perhaps more of us should think about sex all day , provided we manage to move beyond that endless preoccupation with sexual ethics to a simple enjoyment of our sexuality and sensuality .
Should that not always have been the starting point , in our thinking and our talk about sexuality ?
So , yes , I read this delightful book because it makes me think about love , sex and sensuality .
It is easily demonstrated that the decline of the Song ’ s popularity began precisely at the point when it was increasingly recognised that it celebrates human love and sexuality rather than being concerned primarily , or even exclusively , with spiritual matters ( of course , this is not to deny that there is a deeply spiritual side to our sexuality ) .
So does the Song of Song ’ s celebration of human love and sexuality ( and the body ! )

Utah Politician Not Sure It 's Rape When She 's Your Unconscious Wife Utah State Representative Brian Greene is totally against rape , of course .
But , you know , he wonders , totally earnestly , is it really rape if you have sex with someone while she 's unconscious ?
Utah state lawmakers are considering HB 74 , which would tighten the state 's legal definition of rape , to make it easier to prosecute cases where the victim was unconscious or in cases when the perpetrator knows the victim is `` incapable of understanding or resisting the offense . ''
The bill 's sponsor , Rep. Angela Romero , told the Salt Lake Tribune that the bill was `` a long time coming , '' adding , `` At the end of the day , if someone 's unconscious or they 're a vulnerable adult , then the logical answer is : Do n't try to have a sexual relationship with them . ''
`` It looks to me now like sex with an unconscious person is , by definition , rape , '' he said .
`` I hope this would n't happen , but this opens the door to it : an individual has sex with their wife while she is unconscious — or he , the only other way around , if that 's possible , I do n't know .
But a prosecutor could then charge that spouse with rape . ''
Greene later clarified that he was n't trying to `` justify '' sex with an unconscious person , calling it `` abhorrent . ''
But he still did n't like calling it rape `` in every instance , '' he said , `` dependent only upon the actor 's knowledge that the individual is unconscious .

It compelled the bishops of Rome , now deprived of the imperial influence which had hitherto helped them so mightily in their struggles for pre-eminence , to fall back on another element , and that an element which constitutes the very essence of the Papacy , and on which is founded the whole complex fabric of the spiritual and temporal domination of the Popes .

It was sufficient for Freud to announce “ all derives from the sex urge ” and his teachings conquered the world .

Peer to peer intercourse common to civic society – with casual acquaintances , with co-workers , with people met on the street or in the store , social happenings , clubs , all but ceased .
On the other hand , thousands of people had carried out these crimes , often with great enthusiasm and sadism ; ending the killings would have logically meant acknowledging that not only Stalin but thousands of people had massively committed crimes .

PENILE ENHANCEMENT TREATMENTS Penile enhancement can include platelet injections , stem cells , botox to the scrotum , and even dermal fillers to the penis .
What all these have in common is that they help rejuvenate the penis .
Penis fillers are a relatively new form of non-surgical penile enhancement that can help address a variety of concerns including : • Increase in length and/or girth of the penis • Correction of Peyronie ’ s disease • Increase sensation and pleasure during intercourse • Lessening of scarring or skin discoloration • Improved curvature of the penis Results are generally seen immediately and last up to 24 months .
By injecting dermal fillers to the penis , we can increase the penile girth .
While the procedure does not promise to increase the length of the penis , it will appear longer as a result when flaccid .

Ronan ’ s Rants : A short history of same-sex marriage and myths of history Same sex marriage , Religion and Myths of History We are coming up to a vote on marriage equality which is going to shape how Irish society functions for decades to come .
Same sex marriage of sorts –either formal or more informally – have existed at many times in history : Some Roman Emperors like Hadrian probably enjoyed same sex marriages , while ladies amongst the Igbo people of Nigeria had ‘ female husbands ’ .
There have even been claims that the early Christian church itself was in practice tolerant of same sex marriage , at least early on .
polyandry , ( pre-Islamic Mecca ) incest ( Egypt ) and varying other combinations of relationships like 19th-century common-law marriage .
Pre-marital sex was very common in ancient Ireland , while Homosexuality probably wasn ’ t that seriously discriminated against even when the contemporary law tracts bothered to mention it .
But the brake system itself can not determine everything a society does , especially when the evidence generally does not support the dire consequences many same sex marriage opponents maintain .
The issue that I am concerned with is that I don ’ t think that many or at least some of the arguments against same sex marriage come down to evidence .
If you ’ re gon na fuck with me , I ’ m gon na have you killed. ” But then that guy was like , “ I don ’ t know if I can handle it. ” And I was like , “ Of course you can ’ t !

The sexual and reproductive health and rights ( SRHR ) of women and gender minorities are also at risk .
Those living in contexts with weak and uneven public healthcare systems may be unprepared for additional barriers to accessing sexual and reproductive health information and services that will be brought about by more intense weather conditions and disasters .
In terms of SRHR , we know that sexual and reproductive health services have been disrupted , if not blatantly deprioritized .
This is evident in cases documented in the past year of maternal healthcare facilities converted into dedicated COVID-19 facilities and sexual and reproductive health ( SRH ) services , including safe abortion and post-abortion care services , in many areas suspended .

Bozeman Man Sentenced In Missoula To Seven Years In Prison For Receipt of Child Porn MISSOULA – Anthony Dane Roberty , 54 , of Bozeman , Montana , was sentenced today to 84 months incarceration followed by 15 years supervised release , for receipt of child pornography .
In an Offer of Proof filed by Montana Assistant U.S. Attorney Cyndee Peterson , the government stated that if the case had proceeded to trial , the government would have proven that in March 2014 , an FBI agent downloaded files depicting child pornography as part of an online investigation to identify individuals trafficking in child pornography using BitTorrent .
Roberty was interviewed on the day of the search and admitted he used BitTorrent and that agents would find child pornography on his computer and an external hard drive .
A computer and portable hard drive seized from Roberty ’ s residence were found to contain child pornography .
The examiner discovered numerous graphics depicting children engaged in sexually explicit conduct , including sexual conduct between children and adults .
The examiner also found video files that depicted child pornography .
“ Once again , our partnerships with state and federal law enforcement agencies have given us the resources to track down consumers and distributors of child porn , ” said Montana U.S. Attorney Mike Cotter .
Our HSI special agents are trained to identify , investigate and pursue prosecution against these child predators , and rescue their victims – and we take that responsibility very seriously. ” This case was initiated under the Department of Justice ’ s Project Safe Childhood initiative , which was launched in 2006 to combat the proliferation of technology-facilitated crimes involving the sexual exploitation of children .
Through a network of federal , state and local law enforcement agencies and advocacy organizations , Project Safe Childhood attempts to protect children by investigating and prosecuting offenders involved in child sexual exploitation .

At the same time , other states have adopted broad nondiscrimination health protections based on gender identity and sexual orientation .
Gender identity may or may not align with sex or gender assigned at birth .
Transgender Somebody who is transgender has a gender identity different from that traditionally associated with sex assigned at birth .
Gender Dysphoria Gender dysphoria refers to “ a concept [ and clinical diagnosis ] designated in the DSM-5 as clinically significant distress or impairment related to a strong desire to be of another gender , which may include desire to change primary and/or secondary sex characteristics .
The bill additionally states that nurses , counselors , teachers , principals , and other administrative school officials shall not withhold from a minor ’ s parents or guardian that their child ’ s “ perception of his or her gender or sex is inconsistent with the minor ’ s sex ” assigned at birth and shall not encourage a minor to do so .
The court also fond that the plaintiffs were substantially likely to succeed on their claim that these sections of the law are unconstitutional sex discrimination in violation of the 14th Amendment ’ s equal protection clause because the law denies medically necessary services only to transgender minors , while allowing those services for cisgender minors .
In May 2021 , four families of transgender youth and two physicians challenged the Arkansas law in federal court , arguing that the law is illegal sex discrimination under the 14th Amendment ’ s equal protection clause .
specifically and discriminatorily den [ ies ] their access to medically necessary care based solely on their sex assigned at birth. ” A preliminary injunction was granted in July 2021 , temporarily blocking the state from enforcing the law while the case is pending .
They also argue that their states “ protect access to gender-affirming healthcare based on well-accepted medical standards ” and that Arkansas ’ law is unconstitutional sex discrimination and “ ignores medical consensus as well as decisions made between doctors and their patients. ” Litigation in the case continues in the district court , where the case is scheduled for trial during the week of July 25 , 2022 .
revoking or suspending licensure ) on health professionals providing gender-affirming care to minors , in some cases labeling such services as child abuse penalize parents aiding in youth accessing gender-affirming care permit individuals to file for damages against providers who violate such laws limit insurance coverage or payment for gender affirming services or prohibit the use of state funds for such services Beyond these policies , states have also passed or considered other policies restricting access , including so called “ bathroom bills ” which restrict access to bathrooms or locker rooms based on sex assigned at birth , the recent Florida “ don ’ t say gay ” bill that would prohibit classroom discussion on sexual orientation or gender identity , and laws that limit transgender students ’ access to sports .
For instance , one recent study found that state laws permitting the denial of services to same-sex couples “ are associated with increases in mental distress among sexual minority adults. ” In addition , and directly related to health care , Florida recently released non-biding guidance recommending against gender affirming care for youth .
What states have introduced protections related to sexual orientation and gender identity in health care ?
Though not specific to youth access to gender affirming care , some states have adopted policies that provide health care protections to LGBTQ+ people , including : prohibitions on health insurance discrimination based on sexual orientation and/or requirements that state Medicaid programs explicitly cover health services related to gender transition What is federal policy regarding gender-affirming services ?
The Biden administration has taken multiple steps to promote access to health care for LGBTQ+ people and to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity , including : On his first day in office , President Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies to review existing regulations and policies in order to “ prevent and combat discrimination ” based on gender identity and sexual orientation .
The order states that “ people should be able to access healthcare…without being subjected to sex discrimination ” and views sex nondiscrimination protections as encompassing sexual orientation and gender identity , following the Supreme Court ’ s Bostock On May 10 , 2021 , also in light of the Bostock ruling , the Biden Administration announced that the Department of Health and Human Services ’ ( HHS ) Office for Civil Rights ( OCR ) would include gender identity and sexual orientation in its interpretation and enforcement of Section 1557 ’ s prohibition against sex discrimination .
Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) contains the law ’ s primary nondiscrimination provisions , including a prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sex by a range of health care entities and programs that receive federal funding .
The May 2021 announcement marked both a reversal of Trump Administration policy , which eliminated gender identity and sex stereotyping from the regulations , and an expansion of Obama Administration policy , which included gender identity and sex stereotyping in the definition of sex discrimination but omitted sexual orientation .
The guidance relies on ACA Section 1557 ’ s prohibition against sex discrimination , including gender identity , in health programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance ; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act , which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by entities receiving federal financial assistance ; and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) , which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by state and local governments .
Decisions in these cases could determine how such policies intersect with existing federal policies — including Section 1557 ’ s prohibition on sex based discrimination in health care , federal disability non-discrimination protections , and HIPAA patient privacy protections — as well as providers ’ professional ethics standards .

Part sex-positive teen narrative and part cautionary tale about emotional and digital manipulation , Oleander is the coming-of-age portrait of a 17-year-old asserting her sexuality and identity .
And by love I mean sex , and by sex I mean that sexual fulfilment is a fundamental right – Oleander Jones in Oleander Your film ’ s main character , Oleander Jones , is charismatic and direct .
With this short film I wanted to explore issues around the sexual shame that can be put on young women when they ’ re coming of age .
We had great synergy and a shared goal about wanting to … the idea of teenagers learning more about themselves as sexual people .
Oleander is having a few exploratory sexual experiences and is challenged on that by adults instead of being listened to .
When you were a preteen you ’ d argue with teachers about issues like women ’ s autonomy over their bodies… In Catholic school I had abstinence-based education that led me to feel a great deal of shame about my sexuality .
I was very unexposed to topics of consent , STIs , the whole gamut of sex education .
Any sexual experience seemed inherently bad and shameful .
It ’ s about some of the pain a young woman can feel while navigating her growth as a sexual person if she ’ s in a restrictive environment .
I don ’ t want anybody else to feel so much shame about their very natural sexual growth .
I could identify with the abstinence-programme leader ’ s criticism that Oleander uses sex and rocky relationships to hide from her emotions – but I also really felt for Oleander .
I was worried about what she ’ d say or do next… “ Borderline psychological thriller ” : ( from left ) Jennifer Lafleur , who plays a filmmaker , with Peri Gilpin as the abstinence-programme leader ­The film has a borderline psychological-thriller sense to it where you feel : “ Is she going to be OK ? ” There is a kernel of truth in the judgment that Oleander is drowning her emotions in sex but I also feel it doesn ’ t matter why .
She should still be allowed to have a frank , honest , direct conversation about her sexuality that ’ s focused on health and information rather than one based on shutting everything down .
Tell us your thoughts on the messages we get from our culture about young women and sexuality As a media maker I think a lot about how media impacts our lives .
The slut shaming of young women – or the shaming for not being sexual enough : it ’ s always on one side of the equation or the other .
In advertising and the media , young women are sexualised , but at the same time we hide any authentic expression of female sexuality in our culture .
The Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) is very likely to give a film an NC17 rating if it shows a female orgasm .
Female film characters are often treated as disposable or as only sexual – and women are always shown as the prize .
There ’ s pressure to be hypersexual – but in horror films teenage sexuality is often punished by death .
I love Game Of Thrones but in it you see over and over again this idea that just to be a woman – especially a beautiful woman – and walk the earth you ’ re going to be the recipient of sexual violence .
You say that Oleander was a personal , not political , project – but it made you aware of how political sex education actually is .
I ’ ve had interest from producers partly because sex education is a pressing political issue .
I ’ ve now learned how many policy concerns there are in America with states that don ’ t require sex education fully or that mandate damaging abstinence-only sex ed .
Sex educators told me : “ There ’ s no film out there addressing how we approach sex education – not just in the US but around the world. ” The subject matter is somewhat taboo .
You emailed me : “ I want to use Oleander to advocate for comprehensive sex ed , as well as for transparency and honesty in conversations between adults and teens about sexuality. ” What can parents and teenagers get out of watching Oleander ?
When I spoke to a few sex educators , the consensus was that as a parent you ’ d watch Oleander with your teen and it would be a great parent-teen conversation piece .
Or ideally watch it first because of the depictions of sexuality and the language – some people would care about that .
In a way the conversation topics Oleander sparks are maybe the same for teenagers and adults – for a teenager it might be about the kinds of talks related to sexuality and sexual development that you ’ d like to have with adults , and for a parent it might be about reflecting on your teenage years or your relationship with your child .
I hope that Oleander will spark conversation around how conversations about sexual development can be better .
`` Jesus never said he was God , '' she ... '' Wait until marriage to have sex ? ''

Man Found Guilty of Sex Trafficking During Super Bowl LIV Edward Walker faces life in prison after federal jury convicts him of sex trafficking by force and coercion and transporting a person for sexual activity A Connecticut man was found guilty of coercing two women and a 17-year-old girl into sex trafficking during the 2020 Super Bowl in Miami , the Department of Justice announced Friday .
A federal jury convicted 48-year-old Edward Walker on charges of sex trafficking by force and coercion , sex trafficking of a minor and by force and coercion , and transporting a person for sexual activity following an eight-day trial in Fort Lauderdale .
The DOJ accused Walker of bringing the three women from Connecticut to Miami to engage in “ commercial sex acts ” during Super Bowl weekend .
“ While in Miami , Walker emotionally , psychologically , and financially coerced the victims into soliciting customers and having sex with them in exchange for money , all of which Walker kept , ” the DOJ said in a statement .
Federal investigators also found evidence that Walker planned to take his victims to subsequent events like the NBA All-Star Game in Chicago and New Orleans ’ Mardi Gras to “ further sexually exploit them. ” Walker was arrested on February 7th , 2020 by the FBI Child Exploitation and Human Trafficking Task Force in partnership with local authorities .
While events like the Super Bowl and the Kentucky Derby are annually labeled as hubs for sex trafficking , there is no evidence that is the case , with the FBI admitting following Walker ’ s arrest — one of two sex trafficking arrests from the 2020 Super Bowl — “ There is no reliable data to determine the prevalence of human trafficking in any one city or geographic region , nor that there is an increase in human trafficking surrounding large , national events. ” sex trafficking ,

Ms. Cohen graduated , cum laude , with a B.A .
In the landmark gender discrimination case Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins , 490 U.S. 228 ( 1989 ) , the Supreme Court held that an employer could not discriminate against a female employee whose appearance and demeanor did not match feminine sex stereotypes .
First , as Judge Pregerson recognized in his dissent , requiring women to conform to a sex stereotype by imposing a “ facial uniform ” for women , while not requiring any similar uniform for men , is clearly sex discrimination .
Both were issues Reilly looked to `` work his butt off '' away from the ice .

Pope Benedict XVI rarely got credit for having turned the Vatican around on clergy sexual abuse , but as cardinal and pope , he pushed through revolutionary changes to church law to make it easier to defrock predator priests .
( AP Photo/Pier Paolo Cito , File ) While blamed , Benedict fought sex abuse more than past popes VATICAN CITY ( AP ) — Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI is rightly credited with having been one of the 20th century ’ s most prolific Catholic theologians , a teacher-pope who preached the faith via volumes of books , sermons and speeches .
But he rarely got credit for another important aspect of his legacy : having done more than anyone before him to turn the Vatican around on clergy sexual abuse .
And he reversed his revered predecessor on the most egregious case of the 20th century Catholic Church , finally taking action against a serial pedophile who was adored by St. John Paul II ’ s inner circle .
As prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith for a quarter-century , the former Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger saw first-hand the scope of sex abuse as early as the 1980s .
That approach proved disastrous , enabling bishops to move their abusers around from parish to parish where they could rape and molest again .
He hired a relatively unknown canon lawyer , Charles Scicluna , to be his chief sex crimes prosecutor and together they began taking action .
Changes to church law allowed the statute of limitations on sex abuse to be waived on a case-by-case basis ; raised the age of consent to 18 ; and expanded the norms protecting minors to also cover “ vulnerable adults. ” The changes had immediate impact : Between 2004 and 2014 — Benedict ’ s eight-year papacy plus a year on either end — the Vatican received about 3,400 cases , defrocked 848 priests and sanctioned another 2,572 to lesser penalties , according to the only Vatican statistics ever publicly released .
Benedict then took another step and ordered an in-depth investigation into the order that determined in 2010 that Maciel was a religious fraud who sexually abused his seminarians and created a cult-like order to hide his crimes .
Federico Lombardi , says Benedict ’ s action on sex abuse was one of the many underappreciated aspects of his legacy that deserves credit , given that it paved the way for even more far-reaching reforms .

Vatican sanctions Polish archbishop for paedophile cover-up The Vatican has sanctioned a retired Polish archbishop for covering up child sexual abuse , the archdiocese in Wroclaw said Saturday , the latest in a series of such sanctions in the devout country .
The case against Marian Golebiewski , 83 , is just the latest sexual abuse scandal to hit the Catholic church in the predominantly Catholic EU member state .

Here are some highlights , and how I answered them : If I have sex with a dog , and he cums inside me , and I get pregnant , will my baby be a werewolf ?
Which is better , anal sex or vaginal sex ?
Some people prefer anal sex and some prefer vaginal sex .
Also , is this a loving relationship or a reenactment of some porn video you saw ?
Loving gentle sex , anal or vaginal , will probably feel “ better ” than rough sex of either kind .
Anal sex is less likely to result in pregnancy because there is no way for sperm released in the colon to find their way to the egg in the Fallopian tube .
Vaginal sex can result in pregnancy , but anal sex can not .
However , neither is safe in terms of sexually transmitted infections .
If someone has unprotected sex , either anal or vaginal , they might get an infection from their partner .
Some women may say that they are virgins even though they ’ ve had anal sex .
In theory , even one sperm which finds its way to the vagina can swim up the female reproductive tract and result in pregnancy .
However , if your partner is a teen-aged boy , chances are he is masturbating at least once a day .
If the pre-ejaculate picks up some sperm on its way out of his body , and is deposited in the vagina , then yes , it is unlikely , but possible , for a woman to get pregnant .
What does cum taste like ?
Sperm are being deposited into the vagina , a relatively hostile environment .
The woman ’ s vagina is warm and moist , which sounds like a great place for microorganisms , but the woman ’ s body doesn ’ t want infections , so there are defenses .
The main defense is that the vagina is acidic .
Sperm in the vagina are in danger of being denatured , so the ejaculate contains a buffer to neutralize the acid .
I ’ ve heard cum is good for your skin .
Similar to snot , people don ’ t leave cum on their skin .

( AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura ) Trial begins for ex-New York doctor accused of sexual abuse by : BOBBY CAINA CALVAN and LARRY NEUMEISTER , Associated Press NEW YORK ( AP ) — Federal prosecutors in New York began laying out their case Monday against Robert Hadden , a former gynecologist accused of sexually abusing scores of patients over nearly two decades , including the wife of former presidential candidate Andrew Yang .
A grand jury indictment said Hadden sexually abused patients from 1993 through at least 2012 while he was working at two prestigious Manhattan hospitals , Columbia University Irving Medical Center and New York-Presbyterian Hospital .
The former doctor , now 64 , pleaded guilty to state charges seven years ago , admitting that he had sexually abused patients .
She said the “ question is not whether inappropriate activity or sexual abuse happened , ” but whether Hadden knew in advance which patient he was scheduled to see on which days .
In 2020 , she said Hadden sexually assaulted her eight years prior , even when she was seven months pregnant .
Last year , New York ’ s Legislature passed a law temporarily setting aside time limits for victims of sexual abuse to sue their alleged predators .

In the days of King Cotton and plantations , white slave owners routinely used black women as sexual objects , sometimes allowing their teenage sons to pick out a particularly fetching slave to use to initiate them into sexual manhood , although this is scarcely the behavior of men .
They drove her blindfolded into a remote part of the woods , raping her repeatedly over the course of three to four hours , causing so much internal damage that the young woman would never be able to bear children again .
In those days , it was not unusual for African-American women to be sexually assaulted by white men but it was extremely rare for those sorts of sexual assaults to go reported , particularly in places like Abbeville , Alabama where the assault took place .
Although it was uncommon to discuss rape or portray it onscreen in those days , race films depicted it as a part of life because for black women , it was just that .
We continue to live in a rape culture now ; the real consequences of that culture are excellently documented here .
It should also be said that the film ’ s title should warn those who are sensitive or prone to being triggered ; while the description of Recy ’ s attack ( and an attempted sexual assault on another woman ) aren ’ t graphic , they may bring some painful and unwanted memories to the foreground .
Although not graphic , the depictions of rape and attempted rape may be disturbing to survivors .
FAMILY VALUES : The movie contains descriptions of sexual assault and racially-motivated violence .

If you ’ re a boy and a second , third or fourth child , you probably can ’ t remember shit “ I can still remember it like it was a day ago , ” says Aria , 26 .
And if you have a lot of conversation , you have a lot of opportunity to think about those memories , to talk about the memories , to maybe put them into a better context — there are lots of ways that talking about something helps you to remember it. ” Being that I ’ m both a boy and a later-born child , I guess it makes sense that I can ’ t remember shit .
Whatever is happening , it ’ s pretty fucking cool .
“ I told him that cryptocurrencies will eventually replace the dollar and that cryptocurrency is real money that can be used to pay for anything and he said , ‘ Your invisible money sounds like a scam to me. ’ He just dismissed it as bullshit , like I don ’ t know what I ’ m talking about. ” “ It ’ s the same every time , ” he continued .
Maybe you should keep that in mind before getting all bent out of shape over some insignificant stupid shit like Bitcoin or whatever when dealing with your loved ones .
That is n't the point of this at all ; this could be concerning the possession and consumption of heroin or child pornography .
But it 's the least sex I 've had in my life , while in a relationship , for a long time .
When I 'm not having any sex , things kind of go dormant after awhile , I masturbate occasionally and just do n't think about it .
Also , since baby-havin ' is often puts things out of commission for a while , there seems to be a voice in the back of my head yelling at me to get sex in while I can .
If she notices that it 's hard when you 're just changing clothes , or in swim trunks , or in some other situation where sex is n't imminent , what is she going to think ?
Is she going to think that you 're too horny , or having inappropriate thoughts that reflect poorly on you ?
Is she going to wonder from then on if you 're thinking about sex in all sorts of other inappropriate situations ?
Is it going to make her feel all the more cheated the next time you 're both horny , but you feel too tired to have sex ?
Plus , there 's ejaculation .
It 's not an `` oh shit get a towel quick quick '' moment , nor a `` awww ... well , I guess we 're done '' moment .
It 's just an orgasm moment .
I 've received a decent amount of oral sex in my years ( and I tip my hat to the wonderful women to have adventured into the savage lands below my equator ) .
It feels pretty fucking awesome .
What does n't feel particularly awesome ( meaning you never need to go to the trouble of doing this again ) is ramming the tip of my dick into the back of your throat like you 're trying to hammer a bolt into plywood .
The deepthroating effort is appreciated , but deepthroating does not have to result in the head of my dick being bruised with an imprint of your tonsils , and that does , in fact , detract from the overall fun that oral sex most often is .
And bringing this thought all together , we come to the subject of ejaculation and oral sex .
I 've never , never received oral sex from anyone who was not eager to consume the results thereof .
IMHO though I think it 's an incredibly erotic act to swallow .
Giving oral sex is almost as fun as getting it , watching your partner in one of their most intimate , vulnerable and pleasurable moments .
Plus I 'll never accidentally shoot myself in the face with a misaimed blob of jizz .
View Thinker # 91fa37 's profile being a lesbian , i dont often come into contact with a real penis so its always interesting to see what other people say about them .
as for women never going `` oh shit , i need a towel ! ''
I find the very idea incredibly sexy .
haha , of the two women I 've had something like sex with ... the first one was one of those rare female ejaculators one mentioned ....
I never had a goddamn clue with the second one if she was having an orgasm or how close I was or what ... the first one though - I KNEW .
It was surprising at first , and it led to a completely drenched mattress every time we had marathon sex , but it was , as you said , a confidence booster .
Furthermore , while we 're on the subject , I discovered upon performing oral sex on her several times that female ejaculatory fluid tastes pretty much exactly like water .
Even if they 're a female ejaculator , when they cum it 's not `` the end '' in the same way it is when a guy does .
Othertimes our only crime was remembering we had a penis , and the reminder that its there makes it snap to attention .
And the worst of all is the dreaded thought `` The worst thing that could happen right now would be if I popped a boner '' ... once that thought has entered your mind , you 're in goddamn erection city .
Maybe it 's a novelty thing on my part , but I really think that if it were n't for the whole issue of getting aroused at my partner 's hardness , I could play with a penis for hours in end .
The vascular topography of a penis is awesome to see and feel .
It brings to mind things in plant life , like if a tree 's trunk had veins like the leaves , it would be a penis .
I understand that it can happen arbitrarily , like nipple hardness , but is it possible to be horny and not hard ?
I think ejaculation is very cool .
For me , especially after oral sex , it 's kind of like a pat on the back .
I understand that it can happen arbitrarily , like nipple hardness , but is it possible to be horny and not hard ?
It is possible to be horny and not hard .
Like , if going down on someone my thing might be getting ignored and my mind is more focussed on the task at hand ( pun perhaps intended ) I might lose the erection but I would n't say I 'm not still horny , as I 'm still into the whole sex thing .
And yeah , I just answered your other question there : just having an erection often makes us horny , yes .
Random `` morning-wood '' I 'm sure causes a lot of post-sleep sex ...

The plaintiff 's theory of the cause of the explosion was that the `` sole-laying cement `` with which the barrel was filled when bought of the cement manufacturer by the R. H. Long Shoe Company , the shoe manufacturer , was composed of rubber dissolved in naphtha or gasoline ; that when the barrel was sold as an empty barrel by the shoe manufacturer to the defendant , some of this solution still remained in the barrel ; that when the heated tar was pumped by the plaintiff into the barrel through the bung hole , the naphtha or gasoline became vaporized ; that the vapor escaping from the barrel and mixing with the air formed an explosive compound ; that some of this compound reached and was ignited by the flame either of the gas jet fifteen feet distant from the barrel , or of the retort fire twenty-two feet distant ; that there was a flash back from the flame to the barrel , and that when the flash reached the explosive mixture which was confined in the barrel the explosion occurred .
I think the witnesses agree that the explosion must have taken place in consequence of the application of fire to mixed gases somewhere there at the mouth of the barrel , in the bung hole of the barrel , in the barrel or outside the barrel , but how the fire could have reached that gas from the fires which were then burning in that room is a matter upon which there is a great deal of contest , the witnesses for the defendant claiming that it was impossible scientifically that it should have come either from the retort or from the gas jets .

It was alleged that she was paid for sexual favors at these parties , although the allegations were never proven .
In 2010 , Karima El Mahroug , also known as Ruby the Heart Stealer , was thrust into the international spotlight after her involvement in an alleged sex scandal with then-Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi .
It was then revealed that Berlusconi had attended parties at his residences where he had paid young women , including El Mahroug , for sexual services .
El Mahroug denied ever having sexual relations with the Prime Minister and claimed that she had been paid to attend parties to provide entertainment .
Berlusconi was ultimately charged with paying for sex with a minor , although the charges were later dropped due to a lack of evidence .
The trial began in April 2011 and lasted until June 2013 , when Berlusconi was found guilty of paying for sex with a minor and using his influence to cover it up .
During her testimony , she denied ever having sexual relations with him , although she did admit that he had given her money and gifts .
Regardless of how one views the case , it is clear that El Mahroug ’ s involvement in the Berlusconi trial brought much-needed attention to the issue of sex trafficking and the exploitation of minors in Italy .
She first gained attention in 2010 when it was alleged that she had been paid for sex by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi .

And he wanted his clergy to understand HIV , not just to hear that it 's sexually transmitted , that it 's a virus , that , you should n't touch blood , but to really understand it .
So essentially , we are not , asking them about sexual issues .
We do obviously go into conversations about , sexuality , we talk about , this is not a moral disease .
So explain that HIV has a very , thin fragile membrane around it and that has to remain hydrated and that things like salt in tears or enzymes in saliva , all those things destroy that membrane or the proteins in it , so the virus has to be in blood , sal , blood , semen , vaginal fluid or breast milk in order to survive .
That is , not that you know that , you do n't only know that HIV is sexually transmitted , you now know that it is transmitted by contact with semen and breast milk and vaginal fluids , because those are the few solutions that it can survive in .
So yes , it is a result of sexual contact .
But it 's not a punishment for sexual contact which is a big belief that 's been out there .

It might be suggested that prenatal testosterone plays a role in development of sex differences in the human brain .

Introduction – Dr Linda Stalley Three recent reports conducted by ROTA ( Race on The Agenda ) , CEOP ( Child Exploitation & Online Protection Centre ) and the University of Bedfordshire have pointed to the use and abuse of significant numbers of vulnerable children by gangs and groups , usually for sexual exploitation .
This submission sets out details of a particular form of child sexual abuse by groups involved in ritualistic abuse which , in the UK , is most often associated with satanist practice .
This form of abuse is a specific entity which is intentionally sadistic and which involves the worst forms of abuse , including torture , mind control , forced participation in criminal acts and abuse and harm of others , in addition to horrific forms of sexual exploitation .
It is methodical , systematic sexual , physical , emotional and spiritual abuse , which often includes mind control , torture and highly illegal and immoral activities , including murder , child pornography and prostitution .
Although the health sequelae of sexual abuse are becoming more widely recognised there is very little experience or knowledge of the specific problems associated with satanist ritual abuse amongst health care professionals .
Victims of satanist ritual abuse often report forced involvement in criminal activity ranging from mutilation and killing of animals , bestiality , induced abortion and many more horrific acts to desecration of graveyards .
Satanist groups in the UK which ritually abuse children and young people are often also engaged in other types of criminal activity such as the production and distribution of child pornography .
Failure by the authorities to more robustly crack down on such abusive groups leaves them free not only to sexually abuse children and young people but also to conduct other criminal activities .
Below are just a few of several UK cases where satanist ritual abusers were successfully prosecuted and convicted : i ) In March 2011 four adults belonging to a satanist coven were convicted at Swansea Crown Court for sex offences against children and young adults .
ii ) On 9th November 1982 four adults were convicted in Telford , Shropshire , for a series of sexual and other serious offences against children which also involved satanist rituals .
One of the defendants carved an inverted cross on one child ’ s abdomen and branded her genitals with a red-hot altar knife .
iii ) On 23rd July 1987 a man was convicted at the Central Criminal Court in London for the sexual abuse of 15 girls and boys .
iv ) On 8 August 1990 Reginald Harris was convicted at Worcester Crown Court and sentenced to two and half years in prison after admitting to two specimen charges of unlawful sexual intercourse with a 15 year old girl and her younger sister .
v ) On 3rd July 1992 a 57 year old satanist was sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court to 12 years in prison for sexually abusing his niece .

So Comedy Central bought the rights ( “ They paid in the high two figures ” ) and then discovered that there was a brutal rape scene ( “ don ’ t know why I need to cal it a ‘ brutal ’ rape scene any kind of rape , loud or quiet , violent or Cosby-style , is brutal ” ) that would sure be hard to joke about ( they edited it out for the show which “ had a minimal effect on the overall mediocrity of the project. ” The book opens with an FBI warning like the videotapes except for this book it stands for Federal Bureau of Incoherence because the document contains “ many pop culture references that are obscure , out of date , annoying and of no practical use to anyone. ” So each chapter goes through and explains these obscure references for us all .

As a scholar of geographies of gender and sexuality , it had long been a dream of mine to teach a “ Seminar in the City ” ( SITC ) series course with the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies ( CLAGS ) .
Similar to but unlike other critical pedagogies , feminist and queer perspectives on education relate to and develop from issues of gender and sexuality .
Both theories also develop from and speak to issues of gender and sexuality , identical to the focus of QNY .
I sought to make room for discussion around gender , and sexuality in as much as sexual acts in our conversations .
It is in seeing and sharing the multiple layers of our complicated lives that we reveal the imbricated nature not only around gender and sexuality , but also race , class , ability , and other identities , as well as various geographies and moments in time .
Perhaps our most difficult issue that clarified racial , gender , sexual , and class breakdowns was the use of “ we. ” Who was this purportedly LGBTQ shared “ we ” ?
These readings carefully worked across diverse identities ( race , class , gender , and sexuality ) ; a range of experiences ( homelessness , cruising , AIDS activisms , and gentrification ) ; and varied periods of time ( 1890s­-present ) , and spaces and places such the City of New York itself , a specific bar , and neighborhoods ranging from the gentrified and chic West Village in Manhattan to the predominantly working class neighborhood of color Jackson Heights .

In the months following her friends ’ deaths , Wells set out to debunk the myth of black sexual predation and show that lynching was , in fact , a tool of economic terrorism and disenfranchisement .
“ [ The People ’ s Grocery Lynching ] opened my eyes to what lynching really was , an excuse to get rid of Negroes who were acquiring wealth and property and thus keep the race terrorized and ‘ keep the nigger down ’ , ” Wells wrote .
“ Every time word came of people leaving Memphis , ” Wells wrote , “ we who were left behind rejoiced. ” In the months following the People ’ s Grocery lynching , Wells published an editorial in the Free Speech , calling out the myth of black sexual predation : “ Nobody in this section of the country believes the old threadbare lie that Negro men rape white women. ” Instead , Wells argued , many of these relationships were consensual : “ If Southern white men are not careful , ” she determined , “ they will overreach themselves… a conclusion will then be reached which will be very damaging to the moral reputation of their women. ” The Daily Commercial ran an editorial in response , claiming , “ The fact that this black scoundrel is allowed to live and utter such loathsome and repulsive calumnies is a volume of evidence as to the wonderful patience of Southern whites .

From the horse 's mouth : How the EU ’ s Charter of Fundamental Rights WAS to blame for higher insurance prices Over a year ago now , the ECJ ruled that , from December 2012 , insurers can no longer offer different products and prices to men and women based on their sex , since it would constitute discrimination .
In March 2011 , the Court ruled in the Test-Achats case that different premiums for men and women constitute sex discrimination ( MEMO/11/123 ) ... '' This ruling , and the ruling on Greece 's treatment of asylum seekers referred to in the above quote , confirm that the ECJ 's interpretation of the Charter can have a major impact on the UK and is a reminder of the creeping nature of EU law , which tends to undermine national democratic settlements .

I had been exploring the serious allegations of child neglect and abuse leveled at beloved feminist fantasy author Marion Zimmer Bradley , as well as the fact that her husband was sentenced to prison for sexually abusing her daughter ( and some say Bradley actively participated in that abuse ) .
What surprised me most wasn ’ t that Bradley was possibly ( likely ) capable of both failing to protect her minor age daughter and possibly sexually abusing her own child , but that there seemed to be some sort of debate between more conservative and more liberal participants and fans in SciFi as to whether this constituted any sort of “ problem ” with Bradley .

Lana also seems self-aware of the obvious sexuality in her songs , as she croons , “ Putting on my music while I ’ m watching the boys ” in the chorus .
Still , she seems to desire affection from the opposite sex above anything , particularly as she sings “ Live to love you / And I love to love you. ” Regardless of this notion , there ’ s always been a more subtle undertone to her songs that paints Del Rey more as a trickster than a victim .
At one point , Lana sings “ Perfect demon and living single / They never thought that I could be / I know what only the girls know / Lies can buy eternity. ” It ’ s clear here that Lana feels more independent than she often lets on and may flaunt her sexuality just to get what she wants .

Nobody tells you that the ‘ rape talk ’ will be a thing that has to happen before any romantic relationship gets too serious .
Nobody lets you know that immature men will freak out and refer to your rape as “ baggage ” when they cut things off .

While the women have remained anonymous , their union engineering representative Laurence Spencer claims the group has faced sex and gender-based discrimination at BC Ferries for decades .
The women were the first to be convicted under the federal sexual orientation provision to the hate crime law .

One of the main problems now , as I see it , is that we have not been able to find a language for ( heterosexual ) sexuality that is not degrading for both parties .
People seem to pretend that sexuality is something rational you may will yourself through , but it is not , and we lack the customs and the rituals needed to make it good .
As we demystify everything surrounding sexuality and gender we begin to appreciate how malleable it truly is and hopefully permit more tolerance for the way people truly are .

`` In the strongest possible terms , I deny committing any violation of the league 's domestic violence and sexual assault policy , '' Bauer 's statement read .
Bauer , 31 , was accused of sexual assault by a San Diego woman who requested a restraining order and essentially alleged that he took consensual rough sex too far over the course of two encounters last April and May .
Hours after the suspension was announced , The Washington Post published an interview with a woman from Columbus , Ohio , who accused the pitcher of choking her unconscious without her consent dozens of times during their years-long sexual relationship .
She is the third known woman to accuse Bauer of sexual assault .
Bauer accused of sexual assault by third woman Bauer joined the Dodgers on a three-year , $ 102 million contract in February 2021 , on the heels of winning the National League Cy Young Award during the COVID-19-shortened 2020 season .
The Dodgers organization takes all allegations of this nature very seriously and does not condone or excuse any acts of domestic violence or sexual assault .
Bauer is the 16th player suspended since August 2015 , when MLB and the MLB Players Association unveiled their joint domestic violence , sexual assault and child abuse policy , which grants MLB commissioner Rob Manfred the autonomy to suspend players under `` just cause . ''
The prior suspensions -- not counting that of former reliever Felipe Vazquez , who is serving a jail sentence for sexual assault of a 13-year-old girl -- have ranged from 15 to 162 games and were the result of negotiated settlements in which players waived their right to appeal .
The next day , a then-27-year-old woman filed a request for a domestic violence restraining order in which she detailed allegations that Bauer assaulted her over the course of two sexual encounters at his Pasadena , California , home in April and May .
The District Attorney 's Office considered and rejected charges of assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury and sodomy of an unconscious person during the first sexual encounter between Bauer and the woman on April 22 and domestic violence during the second sexual encounter on May 16 .
I never punched her in the vagina .
I never had anal sex with her , or sodomized her in any way .
I never assaulted her in any way , at any time , and while we did have consensual rough sex , the disturbing acts and conduct that she described simply did not occur . ''
The woman , who provided photographs and medical records as part of her domestic violence restraining order declaration , claimed she woke up the morning after the second sexual encounter with two black eyes , a swollen jaw and cheekbones , dark red scratches on the right side of her face , bruised gums , a lump on the side of her head , a split upper lip , black bruising over the top of her vagina and multiple bruises on her right butt cheek .
Over the past two months , while MLB continued its investigation , Bauer 's lawyers filed defamation lawsuits against two media companies , claiming that Deadspin knowingly published false information in its coverage of the sexual assault allegations and that The Athletic led `` a campaign to maliciously target and harass '' Bauer .
The suit claims she `` fabricated allegations of sexual assault , '' `` pursued bogus criminal and civil actions , '' `` made false and malicious statements '' and `` generated a media blitz based on her lies '' in an effort to `` destroy '' Bauer 's reputation , `` garner attention for herself '' and `` extract millions of dollars .

Gaetz , who appears to be facing a multitude of federal and state inquiries into possible sex trafficking and paying for sex , is being buffeted by new revelations almost hourly since the news the Justice Department is investigating him leaked on Tuesday .
“ We are now learning that this Florida bro , basically , you know , turns out , who ’ s running around with an indicted sex trafficker and has been walking around apparently showing his best pictures off his phone to his friends on the House floor of his sexual — I don ’ t want to call them conquests .

It was a frantic conveyance of what they must endure to reap a single most definite route to a livelihood , which , unfortunately for them , only spelt sex slavery .
However , available research indicates that , when trafficking within a country ’ s borders is included in the count , more people fall victim to labor forms of trafficking than sex trafficking .
Although labor trafficking and sex trafficking are usually analyzed as separate trafficking-in-persons issues , victims of both forms of trafficking often share a common yearning : their trafficking ordeal started with a migration in search of economic opportunities .

I realize that this verse is not specifically about this , but that is one of the greatest dangers of a church leader ; falling into sexual immorality , but there ’ s also the risk that they could bring shame to the cause of Christ , to the church , and certainly to themselves , by not working hard in the Word , so Paul is warning young Timothy to work hard at studying the word so that he can be discerning the Word of God properly to be able to teach it correctly .

Steubenville Launches Website on Alleged Teen Rape Just as the season was gearing up late last summer , two Big Red football players were accused of participating in the rape of a 16-year-old intoxicated girl with friends documenting the alleged crime through cellphone pictures and video .
In reality , prosecutors contend that Trent Mays , 17 , and Ma'lik Richmond , 16 , used their hands to penetrate her while she was too drunk to consent , By Ohio law , such a crime constitutes rape , as it does in many places .
The uproar surrounding the case soon split the town into two furious camps ; one that firmly believes there 's a conspiracy to cover up a `` rape culture '' among the football team , and the other believing that the town 's once-stellar reputation is being unfairly tarnished by outsiders who do n't know all the facts .
The intoxicated girl , who would soon be at the center of a rape investigation , made it clear she wanted to leave with Trent , according to the police interviews with several of her friends .
ABC News does not name the victims of alleged sexual assaults .
3 That same boy who videotaped the alleged rape in the car , and who is now a key prosecution witness , testified that when the car arrived at his home , the alleged victim was again taken to the bathroom to throw up .
When the girl emerged , prosecutors say , a second alleged rape occurred .
The eyewitness told police that he saw Trent trying to get the girl to perform oral sex on him while she was lying on the floor .
Next , he says he saw both Trent and Ma'lik 's lying beside her , sexually touching the girl 's groin area with their hands .
At least one other witness claims to have seen the alleged rape .
No physical evidence of a rape was recovered .
Nevertheless , 10 days after the alleged assault , on the strength of the witness accounts , Ma'lik Richmond and Trent Mays were arrested in the middle of the night and charged with rape and kidnapping ( the kidnapping charge was later dropped . )
Trent was also charged with disseminating child pornography for texting naked photos of the underage alleged victim .

Nineteen current and former CBS employees have also alleged that former CBS News Chairman Jeff Fager condoned sexual harassment in his division. ” “ These allegations speak to a culture of toxic complicity at CBS , where the safety of women was continuously ignored to protect the careers of powerful men and the corporation , ” the statement continued .

In my 40 years of work , I have never before heard of such disturbing accusations. ” The first six women accused Moonves of sexual misconduct in a lengthy article published in The New Yorker last month , which also suggested that the company maintains a testosterone-fueled culture where “ everything feels old , the people , the furniture , the culture , the mores. ” One of the accusers is actress Illeana Douglas ( Six Feet Under ) , who reportedly alleges she was fired from a 1997 pilot after refusing Moonves ’ advances , which she says included “ violent kissing ” and holding her down on his office couch .

He isn ’ t just “ the rapist. ” This has nothing to do with justifying or excusing or condoning the rape .
In our hypothetical situation , it ’ s all too easy to look at this uncle solely as a rapist and pretend he never did anything else in his life but rape this woman when she was eight years old .

After we make several exchanges , then comes the self-serving question that I often dread : “ What would you do to my wife ? ” Quite a puzzling question this is , and it is one that usually vexes me to the point that my obvious response that I want to give comes in the form of a retort : “ What the fuck would you think I ’ d want to do to your wife ?
That ’ s the fucking reason you reached out to me in the first place .
Anymore fucking dumb questions ? ” You ’ d think that would be enough to dissuade them from bombarding me with further dumb questions ; on the contrary , it sometimes entices them to go even further : “ How would you fuck her ? ” That ’ s another question that infuriates me .

7 Cures for the Long Term Sex Rut Everyone in a long-term relationship knows what I ’ m talking about when I say “ sexual rut. ” Even if you are one of the few and lucky people who have a pretty good sex life after years of being with your partner , I ’ m willing to bet that it ’ s still quite different from what it once was .
Keeping up a good sex life takes work and time .
A lot of people think that their sex life should be good naturally or else something is wrong with them or with the relationship , but that ’ s not true .
People in long-term relationships who have awesome sex lives have those because they do something and work at it to make it that way .
Have morning sex – It doesn ’ t have to be every single time , but having sex in the morning is a great way to start your day and feel connected to your partner .
Many couples wait until the end of the day to have sex , but that usually means that one or both of your are overtired and not as in the mood .
Another challenge to nighttime sex is that many couples don ’ t go to bed at the same time , so the likelihood of one person nudging the other awake for sex is pretty low .
Surprise each other – It ’ s called a sexual rut for a reason .
Some couples might even feel annoyed when their partners go for the same exact position and sex move as they always do .

I ’ m not suggesting that sex solves problems , but if you have made up then why not try make-up sex ?
Ban sex for a week ( or two ) – You might think this sounds crazy , but I ’ m not talking about not being sexual with each other , but just banning sexual intercourse for a certain amount of time .
What you do is make the decision to do everything BUT sexual intercourse .

Interview Portion of the Beijing News Article on C & E – Full Article Can Be Found Here 新京报：作为推动人之一，为什么想到做这个事情？ 田文昌（全国律协刑事专业委员会主任）：实际上在废除劳教制度后，收容教育制度正在被人们遗忘。但是最近相关案件的出现，让社会重新对它开始有所审视，这个制度到底合不合理，应不应该存在。 新京报：你认为收容教育制度最大的问题是什么？ 田文昌：最大问题是它和劳教制度一样，行政机关可以直接剥夺人的人身自由，没有经过正当的司法程序，执行过程中会出现很多问题。 新京报：会有哪些问题？ 田文昌：比如说，一个卖淫嫖娼人员，在经过行政处罚后，公安机关可以决定是否进行收容教育，这个决定没有特定的标准。再比如6个月到2年的收教，这个期限怎么判定，很可能出现执行偏差。没有正当的司法程序，没有向社会公开，里面容易有猫腻。 新京报：6个月到2年的收教期限，对于卖淫嫖娼处罚重吗？ 田文昌：按照治安处罚法，卖淫嫖娼犯罪行政拘留15天。但是收容教育最高可到两年，这个在很多时候比刑罚还要严重，合不合理是有待商榷的。 废止收容教育或需很长时间 新京报：据你观察，各地公安机关用收容教育制度惩戒的情况多不多？ 田文昌：据我了解，全国绝大多数省份用这个制度的已比较少了。但是这并不表示公安机关没有这个权力，只要有这个权力，就可能出问题。 新京报：收容教育和劳教制度有什么关联？ 田文昌：本质上都属于限制人身自由的制度，是相同的，只是针对的人群和惩戒的期限不同。另外，它们都是没有经过司法程序，行政机关就可以单方决定的制度。从法理上看，收容教育制度并不是公安机关的问题，毕竟以前有这样的相关法规，但是已经和现在法律制度不协调，所以应废止。 新京报：你认为这次建议废止收容教育制度的可能性有多大？ 田文昌：和劳教制度一样，推动废止需要很长的时间，我想废止收教制度也是如此。 Criminal Justice , Human Rights | administrative detention , China , Criminal Law , custody and education , prostitution , reeducation through labor , Rule of Law , Tian Wenchang It ’ s a Man ’ s , Man ’ s , Man ’ s World : Current Efforts to Abolish China ’ s Custody & Education System Actor Huang Haibo Unfortunately , it took the detention of a famous male actor for the Chinese media to criticize an unlawful detention system that has long been used against low-income female sex workers .

A satisfying sex life is healthy and natural .
Most people will experience sexual difficulties at some point in their lives .
If you are in a relationship it is a good idea to involve your partner and attend sex therapy as a couple .
You can also attend sex therapy if you are not in a relationship .
A sexual problem occurs when something in a couple ’ s sex life isn ’ t happening the way that they want it to .
I am skilled and experienced in treating individuals and couples for a range of sexual difficulties including : A lack of sexual desire or differences in sexual desire in a couple A lack of interest or infrequent sex Pain during sex ( dyspareunia ) Penetration difficulties on intercourse ( Vaginismus ) Inability to reach orgasm ( Anorgasmia ) Sex or pornography addiction Sex therapy is a type of talking therapy which supports individuals and couples to communicate openly and honestly about their sexual difficulties so these can be worked through and overcome , leading to a more fulfilling sexual relationship .
A thorough psycho-sexual history of the individual or couple is taken at the start of treatment to determine any medical , psychological , or interpersonal factors which may be contributing to the sexual difficulty .
My therapeutic approach in sex therapy is a combination of psycho-dynamic where I explore and address the psychological or relationship issues which underlie the sexual difficulty , and cognitive-behavioural in which I employ behavioural techniques to focus on alleviating the physical symptoms .
There is plenty of evidence available to demonstrate that sex therapy works .
If you would like to discuss this further or have any questions please contact me and I will be happy to offer advice about how sex therapy may benefit your situation .

Adult Hamlets are one of the few vertebrates that have both male and female sexual organs simultaneously .
There were also falls in robbery offences ( 10 % decrease ) , sexual offences ( 7 % decrease ) and criminal damage and arson ( 8 % decrease ) but there were rises in drug offences ( 21 % increase ) .
Following a broadly stable trend in the first three quarters of the year , criminal damage offences and sexual offences saw large decreases in April to June 2020 .
Other selected offences include rape , attempted murder , homicide and sexual assault .
Types of violence The Crime Survey for England and Wales ( CSEW ) provides the best picture of the overall trend in violent crime and is a more reliable measure of long-term trends in domestic abuse , sexual assault , stalking and harassment .
For similar reasons to domestic abuse , we are unable to provide TCSEW estimates on sexual assault for the year ending June 2020 .
Previous estimates from the CSEW for the year ending March 20204 showed that 2.2 % of adults aged 16 to 59 years had experienced sexual assault ( including attempted offences ) in the latest year .
This was a significant decrease compared with the previous year ( 2.9 % ) , driven by the significant decreases in “ indecent exposure ” or “ unwanted sexual touching ” .
Prior to this , from the year ending March 2014 , there had been a rise in the prevalence of sexual assault estimated by the survey .
Estimates for those aged 16 to 74 years have only been collected since 2017 ; 1.8 % of adults aged 16 to 74 years experienced sexual assault ( including attempts ) for the year ending March 2020 .
The number of sexual offences recorded by the police showed a 7 % decrease in the year ending June 2020 ( 152,977 offences ) from the previous year .
Rape , which accounted for 36 % of all sexual offences recorded by the police , also fell by 7 % , to 55,758 offences .
This follows a decrease of 1 % in sexual offences and 2 % in rape offences for the year ending March 2020 .
Lockdown restrictions largely contributed to the overall decrease seen since the previous year , as the number of sexual offences decreased during the lockdown period by 24 % in April to June 2020 compared with April to June 2019 .
For a subset of forces providing data to the Home Office Data Hub5 , 23 % of sexual offences recorded by the police in the year ending March 2020 were non-recent offences ( those that took place more than 12 months before being recorded by the police ) .
While non-recent offences were an important contributor to rises in police recorded sexual offences in previous years , in the latest year , reports of non-recent offences have decreased along with sexual offences overall .
Further data related to sexual offences can be found in Sexual offending : victimisation and the path through the criminal justice system .
CSEW data on the prevalence of domestic abuse , sexual assault and stalking can be found Table S42 in Annual supplementary tables .
We are unable to provide estimates on sexual assault for year ending June 2020 as these questions are not asked in TCSEW because of the change in survey mode .
Firearms , knife and sharp instrument offences , fraud , offences flagged as domestic abuse-related , corruption , child sexual abuse and child exploitation .
As a result , estimates are not available in relation to sexual assault , partner abuse , abuse during childhood , and the preferred measure of domestic abuse and domestic violence .
Headline estimates exclude offences that are difficult to estimate robustly ( such as sexual offences ) or that have no victim who can be interviewed ( for example , homicides and drug offences ) .

Defence counsel Megan Savard questions Jacob Hoggard at his sex assault trial in Toronto , Tuesday , May 24 , 2022 as his wife Rebekah Asselstine ( left ) and Justice Gillian Roberts ( top left ) look on in this artist ’ s sketch .
THE CANADIAN PRESS/Alexandra Newbould Crown alleges Jacob Hoggard is ‘ sexual opportunist ’ who didn ’ t take no for an answer Defence says Hedley singer disrespectful towards women , but is not a ‘ sadistic serial rapist ’ EDITOR ’ S NOTE : This story contains graphic court statements describing sexual assault Prosecutors allege Canadian musician Jacob Hoggard is a “ sexual opportunist ” who felt entitled to satisfy his particular sexual preferences over the objections of a teenage fan and a young woman .
In her closing arguments at the singer ’ s sex assault trial , Crown attorney Jill Witkin noted Hoggard testified he was confident both complainants consented to their sexual encounters in the fall of 2016 , but couldn ’ t say how they expressed that consent and had no detailed memories of what happened .
But she said Hoggard did not rape the two complainants in the case , one of whom was 16 at the time .
“ His fame and power gave him the capacity to engage in hurtful conduct and two women were hurt by his callous approach to their sexual relationships , ” she said .
He has already admitted and paid the price for that. ” Savard argued the complainants made up the rape allegations because they were “ upset and embarrassed by the way Mr. Hoggard dismissed them ” and the stigma of admitting they regretted a consensual encounter was “ too painful. ” She further suggested the complainants “ needed a sympathetic story to tell that would allow them to save face ” with their close friends and family , and while they never initially planned to contact police , by 2018 , the pressure to do so began to mount .
Hoggard , 37 , has pleaded not guilty to two counts of sexual assault causing bodily harm and one of sexual interference , a charge that refers to the sexual touching of someone under 16 .
The second complainant , an Ottawa woman , testified she agreed to meet Hoggard in Toronto to have sex on Nov. 22 , 2016 .
But instead of having consensual sex , she was raped anally , vaginally and orally , and at one point dragged by the legs into the bathroom , she told the court .
Hoggard testified earlier this week that he had consensual , “ passionate ” sex with each of the complainants in Toronto-area hotels .
He acknowledged some of the acts the women described – including spitting , slapping and calling them derogatory names – may have happened because they were part of his sexual repertoire .

You do n't have to put on the red light The red-light district of a city is the part of town where prostitution and other trades of the sex industry flourish .
Although prostitution is illegal in many countries , including the majority of the United States ( Rhode Island and Nevada are the two exceptions ) , nearly every major city in the world has an area where prostitution and the sex industry are concentrated .
Red is also typically a color associated with sex and prostitution , and many female sex workers in older times dyed their hair red to signify their particular trade .
The women also typically wear big , bangly jewelry , dye their hair ( red , usually ) , and walk around in very high heels and boots to emphasize their sexuality .
You do n't care if it 's wrong or if it 's right The pros and cons of prostitution have been debated in every society for thousands of years , yet the sex trade remains a thriving industry today .
We know from the historical record that the sex industry in some form or another existed in virtually every society in human history .
The Bible never says for sure if she really was a sex worker , but it does make clear that Mary Magdalene repented whatever sins she thought she had committed and became Jesus ' follower , witnessed his crucifixion , and was the first to discover him missing from the tomb .
Women 's groups traditionally rail against the sex industry , citing many instances of girls being forced into prostitution at a very young age , against their will , and who become drug addicts at the complete mercy of their pimps .
Some women view sex work such as stripping and prostitution as sexually liberating because they choose who sees their bodies and who 's allowed to touch , and therefore are much more in control of the situation than the men .
Men sometimes have a real knack for ignoring some pretty obvious deal-breakers in a situation with women that may or may not involve sex , in order to indulge some unrealistic fantasies .
This tendency ( or at least potential ) for customers to fall in love with sex workers can lead to the `` save the stripper '' complex that has worked its way so pervasively into our culture .
( Source ) Megan 's plan did n't work , but the point here is that people are sometimes overcome with a love-induced pity for girls in the sex business and do everything they can to `` save '' them .
`` I would n't have to talk down to ya '' One of the biggest problems associated with prostitution is the sexual , physical , verbal , and emotional abuse that many sex workers experience .
As Dr. Melissa Farley , Founding Director of the Prostitution Research and Education , explained in an article in Psychiatric Times , `` Regardless of prostitution 's status ( legal , illegal , or decriminalized ) or its physical location ( strip club , massage parlor , street , escort/home/hotel ) , prostitution is extremely dangerous for women .
`` I wo n't share you with another boy '' Turning daily casual sex into a business potentially involving hundreds or even thousands of clients not only has some interesting emotional consequences , but also can present physical dangers such as the spread of STIs .
They 're filled with frantic men describing their sexual encounters with prostitutes in detail and then asking medical professionals if whatever they did puts them at risk for STIs/HIV .
The case arose in 2014 , when a 13-year-old youth was arrested for sexual misconduct .
The trial attorney from the county public defender services who was appointed to represent the youth did not question his competency or seek a competency evaluation , because she “ thought that youth ‘ knew what [ she ] was talking about and he knew what he did. ’ ” The youth entered an admission to attempted sexual abuse in the first degree , and the juvenile court ordered up to five years of probation , continued supervision by the county ’ s department of youth services , and registration with the Oregon State Police .
The evaluating psychologist concluded that the youth “ lacked the abilities to understand the nature of legal proceedings , to assist and cooperate with counsel , and to participate in his own defense , and , ‘ to a reasonable degree of certainty that if [ the psychologist ] had evaluated [ youth ] in 2014 , [ she ] would have found him unfit to proceed. ’ ” The youth petitioned to set aside his adjudication , with his new counsel arguing that there was “ a substantial denial of youth ’ s constitutional rights in the proceedings because youth was not competent at the time of adjudication and because he had received ineffective assistance of counsel. ” The juvenile court denied the motion to set aside the adjudication , reasoning , among other things , “ that the attorney ’ s impressions at the time of the adjudication—through her observations of youth—were a more reliable indication of youth ’ s competency than the 2018 psychological evaluation. ” The Court of Appeals of Oregon reversed and remanded with instructions to grant the youth ’ s motion to set aside the adjudication , concluding that the trial attorney ’ s failure to have the youth ’ s competency evaluated “ was not the product of reasonable professional skill and judgment. ” The court explained that , given factors such as the youth ’ s age , the nature of the offense , and the lifetime consequences of his plea to a felony sex offense , “ it was not reasonable for counsel to base her assessment of youth ’ s competency to enter a plea on her conversations with youth , standing alone. ” Citing Restatement of the Law , Children and the Law § 15.30 ( subsequently renumbered as § 13.40 ) and Comment d thereto ( Tentative Draft No .

It provides an atmosphere where they can express themselves physically or sexually in a way that would be acceptable among men and women in a mixed sex venue .
These venues can be attended by people of any sex , any sexual orientation or any gender identity .
It simply wishes to preserve its primarily gay male environment and its non-threatening atmosphere in which gay males can feel comfortable to express affection , physical intimacy or sexuality in a way that will not make them a target of derision , hostility or criticism and where that behaviour might , if expressed in a mixed sex venue , lead to that hostility , derision or criticism .
It seeks to give gay men a space in which they may , without inhibition , meet , socialise and express physical attraction to each other in a non-threatening atmosphere , in a way that heterosexual couples have in mixed sex venues .
The Act now includes attributes of sexual orientation and gender identity .
It has always included the attribute of lawful sexual activity .
Just as it is consistent with the Act 's objective to provide special measures to redress disadvantage suffered by , for example , women or those with disability , so also is it consistent with that objective to provide this venue for those with a particular sexual orientation .
The premise of bans on sexual orientation discrimination is that attitude ( A ) is no reason to exclude people from public places based on sexual orientation : If you do n't like what you think someone is thinking when he 's looking at you , deal with it , do n't have him kicked out .
( 4 ) One can debate whether bans on sexual orientation discrimination ( or other discrimination ) in privately owned public places are sound .
But it seems to me that the project of persuading people to treat people equally without regard to sexual orientation will be more retarded than advanced by having the antidiscrimination law itself discriminate .

Get your ass over here ” , Ruby finally screamed——————————————————————————————————————Ruby lived in a nice high-rise building but nothing extravagant .
It was hot , very erotic , like giving each other a striptease .
My cunt was ablaze .
Nevertheless , it was a slow come together , stroking each other ’ s cunt , sucking on erect nipples and tongue kissing again .
It struck me the next day that , except for that very first night together when we flossed with our cunt hair , we had always rubbed cunts in our make-believe sexfights and rarely made love but often just had sex .
It was sex for people to watch , not really for us.This time we stretched out and 69ed on our side so we could stick a finger up each other ’ s asshole .
We sucked lips , rimmed cunt holes , and sucked clit .
They explained that after the fight they were put in the same cell and eventually had sex .
She put her heavy lips against mine and we undid what we had to in order to get into each other ’ s panties .
Gail ( officially Abigail ) was the sole owner of a chain of beauty parlours where women would have their hair done , nails done , eye lashes done , and even their cunt sucked if they asked the right person .
She was a very sexual person and had no taboos about any part of what could happen between two consenting women.Ruby and I followed her to the bedroom , or I should say the “ pre ” bedroom area .
It got us worked up looking at all those drawings and prints of women having sex in odd places , nuns involved in group sex , high-class women pissing on each other , and many other situations which are difficult to describe .
I was surprised to see real tits on her and made the best of it .
Neither of us was in a hurry to bring on an orgasm right away .
Gail sucked my cunt and I opened up for her , then illegal bahis I sucked hers , which was quite perfumed , a rare Asian smell .
Gail had a beautiful ass and I was anxious to sample it .
We whispered dirty things until we couldn ’ t stand it any longer and she attacked my Irish ass with her full tongue .
She licked and pocked for ever while she stroked my cunt slowly with one hand .
She stopped just before I came and offered me her ass , separating her asscheeks with her fingers , showing me her perfect hole .
I tongue-fucked it and licked her rippled rim , then plunged again with a hard tongue like a small cock .
Her shaved cunt was dripping as I stroked it , with cum juices rolling down my forearm to my elbow .
We lay on our back for a brief pause after the ass play .
I noticed that the blonde was slowly taking out a double-ended dildo she had shared with Ruby in what I thought was a simple cunt rub .
My lover had asked me to work on a full bladder and I understood why when Gail and I resumed our sexual rampage in a plastic hammock set up over the extra-large bath .
We literally showered each other in a massive pissing 69 , our hair drenched , and our bodies covered with the nectar .

In 1851 , Hoosiers voted for Article XIII of the Indiana Constitution that stated , “ No negro or mulatto shall come into , or settle in the State , after the adoption of this Constitution. ” Despite racist legislation and prejudice , Black settlers established a successful farming community in Boone County concentrated in Sugar Creek Township near Thorntown .
Hinton stated on that occasion : “ The forces of truth and the principles of liberty , born in the days of the revolution , and proclaimed in the Declaration of 1776 have placed the negro for the first time in his history on this continent in a position to realize that he is a man and an American citizen. ” [ 10 ] Thomas Kelly , “ The Fifteenth Amendment , ” 1870 , Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division , https : //www.loc.gov/resource/ppmsca.34808/ In 1872 , several prominent men of the Sugar Creek community founded a political organization .
The newspaper implied that the candidates were Quakers and noted that only one of the candidates by the last name of Thistlethwait could “ hold a solid negro vote. ” The support of the Black vote , the newspaper concluded , was needed for Thistlethwait to win the election and was only possible for him if local resident of color , Harvey White , “ sticks to him. ” [ 14 ] The Pioneer was staunchly Democrat and often blatantly racist , so it is quite possible that these statements were meant to discredit the candidate .

This attribute aside ( and the rather placid Anna Boleyn also employs them a couple times ) , Sumurun and The Wildcat could scarcely be more different ; the former is a rather complex series of romances and heartbreaks , cut with some rather audacious comedy bits involving a corpse , and a Keystone-Cops-esque chase scene involving a bunch of girls from the sheik ’ s harem and their eunuch guards ; the latter is a military screwball comedy of sorts , in which a lieutenant falls for a bandit girl living in the wilderness .

Afghanistan : In rare move , government launches investigations into systematic sexual abuse of children Post category : Child Sexual Abuse/Ministry of Interior/Statements & Messages Press release Geneva/Kabul , 7 January 2020 – Two human rights organisations welcome the move by the Attorney General ’ s Office of Afghanistan to initiate investigations into the systematic and culturally widely accepted sexual abuse of boys by State officials , warlords and other powerful individuals .
“ We very much welcome the investigation into the widespread sexual abuse of children , a tabooed practice that has been ignored by the public and the government alike for decades. ” In November 2019 , Ehsanullah Hamidi and Musa Mahmoudi , who worked for CSHRN , revealed the sexual abuse of hundreds of boys from six different schools in the Logar province , with teachers , headmasters and local officials involved .
Afghanistan has a long history of sexual abuse of children by private individuals as well as State officials , amounting to torture and other ill-treatment .

But will this galvanize the powerful secular media , those in high politics and sadly enough the Judas Iscariots in the Church who truly hate the Catholic Church 's traditional teachings in general and truly hate Pope Benedict in particular because he is such a threat to the secularists ' domination of Europe .
This is why we need a new Liturgical Movement , which will call to life the real heritage of the Second Vatican Council. ” Pope Benedict XVI in his Pastoral Letter to Catholics in Ireland situated the sexual abuse of children in the wake of fast-paced social change and a decline in adherence to traditional devotional and sacramental practices .
There 's a brief article from AP on the Georgia mega church ( Baptist ) pastor , Bishop Eddie Long who has been accused of sexual abuse by two men , now 20 and 21 .
The reporter went to great lengths to say that the men allege the abuse happened when they were 17 or 18 , but that Georgia State Law says the age of sexual consent is 16 !
Have you ever heard a reporter declare what the age of sexual consent is in any state where a priest has been accused of similar crime ?
More and more we are learning that when a person who has religious authority , such as a bishop , priest or minister , ( Catholic , Protestant , Jewish , Orthodox , Muslim , etc ) abuses a child or a teenager by taking advantage of them sexually , that this type of abuse has even greater traumatic , psychological consequences for the one abused .
Was that sexual abuse ?
Read about a Glenmary priest in my diocese who was cleared of allegations of sexual abuse in West Virgina .
In between , we all are buffeted by issues surrounding human sexuality based upon a secular and non Christian agenda .
The most controversial issues of sexuality that potentially could lead some Catholics into schism or to join current Protestant denominations , such as the Episcopal Church , are issues surrounding artificial contraception , abortion , marriage , divorce , homosexuality , and women ’ s ordination and medical ethical issues .
Doing so keeps the Catholic Church together. ” It should be of no irony that many Catholics now attack the pope , question his authority over the universal Church and carp at any perceived inaction as it concerns the discipline of the clergy in the area of sexual abuse .

Child maltreatment is identified as all types of abuse against a child under the age of 18 by a parent , caregiver , or person in a custodial role , and includes physical abuse , sexual abuse , emotional abuse , and neglect ( Fortson et al. , 2016 ) .
In the first section of the questionnaire , Training in Child Abuse Reporting , participants were asked to list where they obtained their knowledge of child abuse reporting and to assess four different types ( physical , sexual , neglect , emotional ) of child abuse .
Physical child abuse cases ( M = 4.03 , SD = 7.12 ) were reported at a higher rate than cases of neglect ( M = 2.72 , SD = 5.10 ) , emotional abuse ( M = 0.56 , SD = 1.52 ) , and sexual abuse ( M = 0.57 , SD = 1.37 ) .
Participants reported most confidence in their ability to identify physical abuse ( M = 3.49 , Mdn = 4 ) , followed by neglect ( M = 3.30 , Mdn = 3 ) , sexual abuse ( M = 3.20 , Mdn = 3 ) , and emotional abuse ( M = 3.06 , Mdn = 3 ) .
This finding supports the assertion that types of abuse with visible evidence are more identifiable than other types of abuse such as emotional or sexual abuse ( Bryant , 2009 ; Bryant & Milsom , 2005 ) .
The influence of personal and professional characteristics on school counselors ’ recognition and reporting of child sexual abuse .
For the purpose of this article , child abuse and neglect are defined by the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act Reauthorization Act of 2010 ( 2010 ) as “ any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker which results in death , serious harm , sexual abuse , or exploitation , or an act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm ” ( p. 6 ) .
Maltreatment includes “ medical neglect , neglect or deprivation of necessities , physical abuse , psychological or emotional maltreatment , sexual abuse , and other forms included in state law ” ( U.S. Department of Health & Human Services [ USDHHS ] , Administration for Children , Youth and Families , & Children ’ s Bureau , 2019 , p. 108 ) .
A study by Bryant and Milsom ( 2005 ) found the second most reported legal issue experienced by school counselors was whether to report alleged sexual abuse .
Furthermore , according to Davis ( 1995 ) and Sikes ( 2008 ) , the reporting of child and sexual abuse cases are the second highest reasons for school counselors to attend court .
Generally , most school counselors felt confident in their knowledge to recognize physical abuse ; however , fewer counselors reported certainty in identifying sexual as well as emotional abuse ( Bryant , 2009 ; Bryant & Baldwin , 2010 ; Bryant & Milsom , 2005 ; Kenny & Abreu , 2016 ) .
Conversely , certain forms of abuse , such as sexual and emotional abuse , are not as easily recognized by school counselors ( Bryant & Baldwin , 2010 ) .
A study conducted by Bryant and Milsom ( 2005 ) stated three-quarters of school counselors in the study felt sure of their ability to identify child physical abuse , but less so in their ability to recognize sexual and emotional abuse .

The papers allege that Kelly arranged for some of the victims to meet him on the road for illegal sex .

Former Hollywood studio boss Harvey Weinstein tested positive at the prison in New York where he is serving a 23-year sentence for rape and sexual assault , the head of the guards union said .
It meant that federal money could not be spent on abortions except in the cases of rape , incest , or if the life of the mother was in danger .
Vox reports he , ” says it would make people “ consider the repercussions ” of having sex .
Its official platform on abortion doesn ’ t even make exceptions for rape , incest , or the life of the mother .
Most especially , they oppose education about sex and contraception for teenagers .
Exceptions for Rape , Incest , and the Life of the Mother Most abortion bills have exceptions if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest , or if it would endanger the life of the mother .
Notably , at least two of these latest bills , Alabama and Missouri , do not have rape and incest exceptions .
However , even most of those who are anti-choice and want to force women to give birth , also want to see an exception for rape and incest .
So , why do they feel differently when a woman becomes pregnant against her will but whose sexual activity was willing ?
If they ’ re not married , they shouldn ’ t be having sex anyway .
This all gives them a picture of women who have abortions as young , sexually promiscuous , irresponsible , and , most importantly , not behaving in a manner that meets with God ’ s approval .
Neither the women or the men , of course , had a choice whether they had sex . )
… even most of those who are anti-choice … also want to see an exception for rape and incest.… They can see that the choice of the woman , who is already a person , should take precedence over something that only has the potential to be a person .
There was a huge amount of guilt associated with anything to do with sex for them .
When I think back , it ’ s a wonder anyone ( including me ) managed to emerge with a healthy view of sex and sexual relationships .
Firstly , I particularly appreciate you showing that the so called ‘ pro-life ’ stance is not about reducing the number of abortions , and that there are ulterior motives ( presumably controlling women ’ s lives and/or sexuality ) .
Indeed , as you say , the only way shown to reduce the numbers of abortions is serious sexual education and easy availability of contraceptives , there really is no doubt about that , and it cab ’ t be stressed enough .
One would expect the so called ‘ pro-lifers ’ to be on the barricades for exactly that : serious sexual education ( at a young age at that ) and easy availability of contraception .
on demand until , say , 12 weeks , for serious socio-economic and psychological circumstances up to , say , 18 weeks , and for incest and rape we may add a few more weeks .
I was profoundly grateful for any young lady who did give me a fling , how could I blame them for sharing a modern enlightened attitude to sex ?
Pregnancy , like any sexually transmitted disease , was to be avoided at all costs but if the worst happened , reliably curable if caught early enough ; nobody in their right mind would go through it unnecessarily .
Public opinion has shifted rapidly in favor on the issue , and the Supreme Court decision this summer on whether states can ban same-sex marriage and whether federal benefits should flow to same sex partners promise to roil the water again .
That ’ s how you can be happy. ” Or we will butt up against it for the rest of our lives .

Education Faith Front Page Health WorldWND EXCLUSIVE 6th-grade porn teachers exposed Social civil war erupts over government 's advocacy for Kinsey 'myths' A social civil war is tearing apart a corner of Europe that previously survived a communist regime and emerged from war and violence into a form of democracy – and it 's all over a dead sex researcher who based much of his research on pedophiles .
Reisman , who was the principal investigator for a Department of Justice research project on child sex abuse , told WND today she is working with attorneys in the former Yugoslav republic .
The genesis of the story is a move by the Croatian government to impose a Kinsey-based sex education program on school children without parental input or alternatives .
As Reisman has documented in her book , `` Kinsey : Crimes & Consequences , '' Kinsey 's controversial reports 50 years ago on human sexuality `` involved illegal sexual experimentation on several hundred young children . ''
His survey , she wrote , `` was based on a nonrepresentative group of Americans – including hundreds of sex offenders , prostitutes , prison inmates and exhibitionists . ''
She told WND one of the authors of the proposed sex curriculum in Croatia , Aleksandar Stulhofer , is linked to Kinsey 's research and the ongoing work of an institute that bears Kinsey 's name .
According to Project Censored , a respected Croatian journalist working for a state-run network , Karolina Vidovic-Kristo , reported Dec. 29 , 2012 , on the government 's new policies and strategies on sex education .
`` The program , as are most Croatians , was critical of the government policy and the foundations on which the [ sex education ] program is based , '' the report said .
She said she fears for Croatia , which as a historically conservative country has a low rate of sexually transmitted diseases .
`` It 's absolutely crystal clear in his own words , he was using pedophiles to sexually assault children , '' he said .
He noted that even today , Kinsey 's claims are the basis for much of sex education around the world .
`` Yet here was this appalling record of the sexual assault and I think in some cases you could call it torture of children masquerading and science , '' he said .
And he said the issue at hand – Kinsey 's `` myth '' that children are sexual from birth – is significant .
According to supporters for the Croatian journalist , the government introduced the mandatory sex education just last fall , without any discussion with parents or religious leaders .
It 's premised on Kinsey 's contention that children are sexual from birth .
Just last year , Reisman , the principal expert investigator for a U.S. Justice Department study on child sex abuse , said pedophilia advocates are using the same strategy that was successfully employed to make homosexuality a classroom subject for small children in the nation 's public schools .
As WND reported , Reisman attended a symposium held by the `` minor-attracted people '' advocacy group B4U-ACT to disseminate `` accurate information '' on the position that pedophilia is just one more alternative sexual orientation .
Her books , including `` Kinsey : Crimes and Consequences '' and `` Sexual Sabotage , '' show that Kinsey 's research was based on `` illegal sexual experimentation on several hundred young children . ''
Kinsey 's extreme view of sexuality is typified by a statement posted on the website of the North American Man-Boy Love Association , which advocates sex between adults and children .
The statement , from Kinsey 's book `` Sexual Behavior in the Human Female , '' defends adult-child sex and accuses those who object to it of being responsible for `` serious effects '' suffered by children : '' When children are constantly warned by parents and teachers against contacts with adults , and when they receive no explanation of the exact nature of the contacts , they are ready to become hysterical as soon as any older person approaches , or stops and speaks to them in the street , or fondles them , or proposes to do something for them , even though the adult may have had no sexual objective in mind .
Some of the more experienced students of juvenile problems have come to believe that the emotional reactions of the parents , police officers , and other adults who discover that the child has had such a contact , may disturb the child more seriously than the sexual contacts themselves .
The current hysteria over sex offenders may very well have serious effects on the ability of many of these children to work out sexual adjustments some years later . ''
WND Managing Editor David Kupelian , shortly after publication of `` The Marketing of Evil '' in 2005 , predicted publicly that the next `` liberation movement '' to assault America would be `` the mainstreaming of adult-child sex . ''
Remember , consensuality has replaced morality in today 's legal system , so a young person 'consent ' to have sex will ultimately trump the old-fashioned desire to protect the innocent .
Also , since adult-child sex is a 'cultural preference ' in certain non-Western countries , child-molestation lobbyists are now making the argument that criminalizing adult-child sex amounts to condemning another culture .
Privately , We Have Misgivings ” The New York Times ’ reactionary sexual harassment campaign runs into opposition In a column Friday in the New York Times , “ Publicly , We Say # MeToo .
Privately , We Have Misgivings , ” critic and novelist Daphne Merkin acknowledges there is considerable opposition to the current sexual misconduct witch-hunt even within its target demographic .
‘ What ever happened to flirting ? ’ and ‘ What about the women who are the predators ? ’ Some women , including random people I talk to in supermarket lines , have gone so far as to call it an outright witch-hunt. ” Leaving aside Merkin ’ s individual history and motives , the appearance of the column with its acknowledgement of considerable hostility among middle-class women to the sexual misconduct campaign is a serious admission , if not a backpedaling , on the part of the Times itself .
The article pointedly refers to a number of phenomena we have discussed on the WSWS , including the return “ to a victimology paradigm for young women , in particular , in which they are perceived to be—and perceive themselves to be—as frail as Victorian housewives. ” Furthermore , the columnist rightly characterizes the campaign to remove a painting by Polish-French artist Balthus from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York as “ the kind of censorship practiced by religious zealots. ” Merkin notes a “ disturbing lack of clarity ” about terms such as harassment , assault and “ inappropriate conduct. ” She observes , moreover , that expressing “ sexual interest is inherently messy and , frankly , nonconsensual—one person , typically the man , bites the bullet by expressing interest in the other , typically the woman—whether it happens at work or at a bar .
Some are now suggesting that come-ons need to be constricted to a repressive degree ... We are witnessing the re-moralization of sex , not via the Judeo-Christian ethos but via a legalistic , corporate consensus ...
In some cases , the sexual misconduct campaign has opened up new career and economic possibilities .
To be brutally frank , there is a great difference between the situation facing a working class woman , on the one hand , for whom acquiescing to sexual pressures in a factory or office may be virtually a life-and-death issue , and the choices open to an entertainer or performer , on the other , who plays along in the interests of advancing a career .
That ’ s what I find myself wondering as I hear story after story of adult women who helplessly acquiesce to sexual demands. ” However , where Merkin ’ s column falls down terribly is in its acceptance of too many of the assumptions of the sexual misconduct campaign ( despite her recognition that in the current climate “ to be accused is to be convicted ” and that “ due process is nowhere to be found ” ) and her failure to examine the broader , political implications .

https : //t.co/vrUeKGSLg4 — Carrie Pasquarello ( @ glosecresources ) April 4 , 2022 For all the talk these days about “ protecting ” children by cracking down on sex education , little thought is given to how discussing those topics in the classroom — or at home — could prevent a tragedy of this kind .
Schools would do well to teach children that they can and should reach out to grown-ups in this situation — that law enforcement will take action against blackmailers — as well as provide a robust education that demystifies sex and weakens the taboos around it .
Instead , on a broad front , drastic treatment with high doses of sex hormones and breast and genital surgery is introduced .

However , domestic violence , dating violence , sexual assault and stalking often negatively impacts victims ’ ability to maintain employment .
[ 15 ] Already , 25 States and the District of Columbia have laws that explicitly provide unemployment insurance to domestic violence victims in certain circumstances ; however , these laws vary in the extent to which they effectively address the special circumstances of victims of domestic violence and very few of the laws explicitly cover victims of sexual assault or stalking .
[ 16 ] Five States provide victims of domestic or sexual violence with leave from work to go to court , to the doctor , or to take other steps to address the violence in their lives , and several other States provide time off to victims of crimes , which can include victims of domestic and sexual violence , to attend court proceedings .
However , many States have no employment-protected leave provisions that allow victims of domestic or sexual violence to take the time off they need to address the violence .
[ iv ] Please tell your friends , families and everyone you know who cares about eradicating domestic violence , dating violence , sexual assault and stalking that .
Commit to ending domestic and sexual violence with this concrete action you can take to support VAWA : TAKE ACTION TOMORROW !

are not I'm 00:12:48 00:12:52 definitely putting this out before I'm 00:12:49 00:12:54 doing this this is huge okay this is why 00:12:52 00:12:56 I have it on my board this is one of the 00:12:54 00:12:57 main reasons I 'm in Las Vegas not going 00:12:56 00:12:59 to explain exactly what it is or what 00:12:57 00:13:02 else I 'm doing but I 'm doing a live 00:12:59 00:13:04 stream a live stream at the end of this 00:13:02 00:13:06 month in August there 's two options - 00:13:04 00:13:07 two time options I believe still on the 00:13:06 00:13:08 thing because obviously people in 00:13:07 00:13:10 different time zones want to make sure 00:13:08 00:13:11 you guys can have both but click the 00:13:10 00:13:13 link I 'll leave it linked down below you 00:13:11 00:13:14 can check some of the last videos - it's 00:13:13 00:13:16 going through and not only showing 00:13:14 00:13:17 exactly what I do with Facebook ads a 00:13:16 00:13:19 lot of these strategies and things that 00:13:17 00:13:21 I 've never seen revealed anywhere 00:13:19 00:13:23 because they do n't exist like it 's kind 00:13:21 00:13:25 of weird to say it or think about it now 00:13:23 00:13:26 but I mean half of that stuff I created 00:13:25 00:13:28 it was off spending hundreds and 00:13:26 00:13:29 hundreds of thousands actually now well 00:13:28 00:13:31 over a million dollars of Facebook ads 00:13:29 00:13:33 spent so for those who do n't know that's 00:13:31 00:13:35 primarily what I do I 've run ecommerce 00:13:33 00:13:36 stores yes it still works all the idiots 00:13:35 00:13:38 out there like

Superintendent took 6 months to confront Little Chute teacher accused of student assault LITTLE CHUTE - Little Chute Area School District Superintendent David Botz took months to confront a teacher who had been accused of sexual assault by a former student in 2009 , according to a report Botz wrote after looking into the allegation .
In October 2009 , the former student reported the sexual misconduct allegation to high school staff , who made a report to Botz .
In an email the following month , the student wrote that when Jason LaVigne was her teacher in keyboarding class 10 years earlier , he would rub his penis against her as he walked by the back row where she sat .
READ : Superintendent Botz 's report after investigating the sexual assault allegation RELATED : Little Chute superintendent knew of sex assault allegation against teacher in 2009 RELATED : Little Chute superintendent did n't believe he had to report former student 's allegation That conclusion stands in stark contrast to the felony charge the Outagamie County District Attorney 's Office brought against LaVigne last month after detectives learned of Botz 's report in the midst of a separate child sexual assault investigation involving LaVigne .
She said the contact would last between five and 10 seconds and that once LaVigne asked her to perform sex acts on him , the complaint states .
`` I understand the deep concern everyone in our community has in the matter related to current sexual assault charges against a high school staff member , as well as concerns related to my handling of an investigation of that staff member in 2009 , when allegations regarding an incident 10 years prior were first reported to the district , '' Botz said at the meeting , according to a copy of his statements released by the school district .
LaVigne is charged in Outagamie County with repeated sexual assault of a child , which carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in the prison system .
LaVigne also is charged with third-degree sexual assault in Marinette County court .
According to the criminal complaint in that case , a 16-year-old girl reported he sexually assaulted her in early June while she was on a pontoon boat near Crivitz .
While Lavigne 's daughter was either passed out or asleep on the boat , LaVigne sexually assaulted her , the girl told police .
